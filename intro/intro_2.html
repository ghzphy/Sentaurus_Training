<h1>2.1 Sentaurus Workbench</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Workbench is the graphical front end that integrates Sentaurus
simulation tools into one environment. Its  user interface is used to design, 
organize, and run simulations for semiconductor research and manufacturing. 
Simulations are comprehensively organized into projects.</p>

<p>A simulation flow typically consists of several tools, such as the process 
simulator Sentaurus Process, the meshing tool Sentaurus Mesh, the device 
simulator Sentaurus Device, and the plotting and analysis tool Sentaurus Visual.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Workbench automatically manages the information flow from one 
tool to another. This includes preprocessing user input files, parameterizing 
projects, setting up and executing tool instances, and visualizing the results.</p> 

<p>Sentaurus Workbench allows you to define parameters and variables to run 
comprehensive parametric analyses. The use of mathematical and logical 
expressions serves to preprocess the simulation input dynamically. The resulting 
data can be used with statistical and spreadsheet applications.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../swb/swb_menu.html">Sentaurus Workbench module</a>.</p>

<h1>2.3 Sentaurus Topography 3D</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Topography 3D is a three-dimensional (3D) simulator for evaluating 
and optimizing critical topography-processing steps such as etching and deposition.</p>

<p>The two-dimensional (2D) mode of Sentaurus Topography 3D makes the physical 
models available for 2D structures as well. Therefore, both 2D and 3D structures 
can be simulated with consistent results.</p>

<p>The main Sentaurus Topography 3D functionality for advanced etching and deposition 
modeling is supported by the Sentaurus Process and Sentaurus Interconnect tools. 
This integration enables users of Sentaurus Process and Sentaurus Interconnect to easily 
incorporate one or more etching and deposition process steps into their simulation flow 
without having to create a separate command file and simulation node for Sentaurus 
Topography 3D.</p>

<p>Moreover, advanced lithography processes can be simulated with Sentaurus Topography 3D 
by invoking Sentaurus Lithography commands from within Sentaurus Topography 3D.</p>

<h1>2.4 Sentaurus Structure Editor</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Structure Editor is a 2D and 3D device editor, and 3D process 
emulator. It has three distinct operational modes: 2D structure editing, 3D
structure editing, and 3D process emulation. Geometric and process
emulation operations can be mixed freely.</p>

<p>From the user interface, 2D and 3D device models are created geometrically 
using 2D or 3D primitives such as rectangles, polygons, cuboids, cylinders, 
and spheres. Three-dimensional regions also can be created by extruding 2D 
objects or sweeping 2D objects along a path.</p> 

<p>Sentaurus Structure Editor offers state-of-the-art visualization. 
Structures are displayed as they are created and powerful view filters
make it possible to select only a subset of regions or make certain
regions transparent.</p> 

<p>Doping profiles and meshing strategies are defined
interactively. Placements are visualized as semitransparent boxes for
easy verification. All doping and meshing options of the mesh
generation tool Sentaurus Mesh are supported.</p>

<p>The user interface features a command-line window, in which Sentaurus Structure Editor 
prints script commands corresponding to the user interface operations. 
Script commands also can be entered directly in the command-line window.</p>

<h1>2.10 Sentaurus Data Explorer</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Data Explorer is a tool for editing and converting 
files in TDR format, which is the standard file format for 
exchanging data between TCAD Sentaurus tools.</p>

<p>On the command line, you can use simple commands to convert files 
to different formats and to create new files by copying and modifying 
files. This is most convenient when converting many files at the same 
time, using a batch file or script, and then continuing to work with 
these files in other tools.</p>

<p>The batch mode allows you to use the full flexibility of the 
Tcl/Tk programming language to manipulate TDR file datasets.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../tdx/tdx_menu.html">Sentaurus Data Explorer module</a>.</p>

<a name="garand"></a>
<h1>2.12 Garand</h1>

<p>Garand is a TCAD device simulator that models the electrical characteristics 
of individual CMOS transistors. The base simulator is a finite-difference drift-diffusion 
simulator. Garand also uses the density gradient model of quantum corrections to account 
for quantum-mechanical confinement in a device structure.</p>

<p>The variability engine, Garand VE, has been developed primarily for modeling 
statistical variability. Variability sources associated with random discrete dopants, 
line edge roughness, polycrystallinity of gate materials, and interface-trapped charges 
can be activated and configured from the input file.</p>

<p><a href="images/ov_garand.png"><img src="images/ov_garand.png" width="500" 
alt="Potential distribution in a FinFET example simulated by Garand VE" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 11. Potential distribution in a FinFET example simulated 
by Garand&nbsp;VE, showing statistical variation from random discrete dopants and 
metal gate granularity. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>Garand MC is a Monte Carlo simulator for devices, with a three-dimensional,
self-consistent, ensemble quantum-corrected Monte Carlo engine. It can simulate both 
electron and hole transport in various default calibrated materials.</p>

<p>Garand, Garand VE, and Garand MC are simulation tools in the TCAD to SPICE product family. 
They all use finite-difference tensor meshes. In order for a device structure including 
doping information generated by TCAD Sentaurus tools, such as Sentaurus Process, to be 
compatible with Garand, Garand&nbsp;VE, and Garand&nbsp;MC, tensor mesh conversion using 
Sentaurus Mesh is required. This is demonstrated in the Sentaurus Mesh module, 
<a href="../smesh/smesh_07.html#6">Section&nbsp;7.6 Tensor Mesh for Garand VE</a>.</p>
