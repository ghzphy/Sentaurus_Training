<h2 class="obj">Objectives</h2>

 <li>To demonstrate how to perform device electrical breakdown simulations in 
 Sentaurus Device for a 2D NMOSFET device, operating in the off-state regime.</li>
</ul>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1"></a>
<h1>11.1 Overview</h1>

<p>In general, device breakdown simulations and off-state device breakdown simulations, 
in particular, are often difficult perform. In the prebreakdown regime, a current is 
small and almost constant or, at least, relatively flat. In this case, a voltage-controlled 
bias sweep works best. In the postbreakdown regime, however, even a small voltage change can 
lead to a huge current increase, so that sometimes even a snapback can occur due to the dominance 
of the avalanche generation term in that regime.</p>

<p>Different breakdown methods are available in Sentaurus Device, each having 
certain advantages for a particular device operation regime.</p>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>11.2 Comparison of Breakdown Methods</h1>

<p>Table 1 lists the methods suitable for device electrical breakdown simulations 
and briefly compares their advantages and disadvantages in terms of simulator 
performance, accuracy, and applicability.</p>

<caption>Table 1. Comparison of different breakdown methods.</caption>

<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Limitations</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Approximate breakdown analysis</td>
<td>Fast; it does not consume much memory since it requires only the Poisson analysis. 
Qualitatively produces reasonable results.</td>
<td>Can be applied only to off-state breakdown problematics, where currents are still 
negligibly small. Quantitatively not very precise; usually underestimates a breakdown.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ionization integrals with carriers analysis</td>
<td>Similar to approximate breakdown analysis in terms of ionization integrals computation. 
This method solves the entire carrier transport task, having the avalanche term 
deactivated in the right-hand side of the continuity equation, but computed 
in a postprocessing step.</td>
<td>Requires educated guess from user to decide when to stop a simulation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>External resistor method</td>
<td>Simulation is performed in one effort with the bias applied through an external 
resistor connected to a device electrode in series.</td>
<td>Requires user intervention or iterations to establish a load resistor.
Simulation might not converge if the device goes into snapback.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Voltage-to-current boundary condition (BC) switching method</td>
<td>Flexible method for most complicated curve shapes, including curves with negative 
differential resistance behavior.</td>
<td>Sensitive to a chosen time step at the voltage-to-current BC switching point.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Continuation method</td>
<td>Automatically defines the external load resistance by monitoring the curve slope.</td>
<td>Sensitive to grid quality and linear solver settings. Does not like noisy currents. 
Can be more computationally expensive than other methods.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Transient method</td>
<td>Similar to the external resistor method, but uses the transient bias ramp 
instead of quasistationary. Useful in cases where traps are considered or a simulated 
structure includes floating semiconductor regions.</td>
<td>Same as the external resistor method. Since a bias ramp time can potentially 
affect the results, the transient method should be used with care.</td>

<p>The complete project that demonstrates these breakdown methods and focuses 
on a MOSFET off-state breakdown simulation can be investigated from within 
Sentaurus Workbench in the directory 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>BVMethods</tt> project parameter value decides which method to use for 
a breakdown simulation. After project preprocessing in Sentaurus Workbench, 
the corresponding command inputs are generated.</p> 

<p>To visualize characteristic curves, select the Sentaurus Visual nodes of
interest, and click the <strong>Visualize Selected Nodes Together</strong>
toolbar button (see <a href="../swb/swb_02.html#VisTogether">Section&nbsp;2.7

<h1>11.3 Approximate Breakdown Analysis</h1>

<p>Approximate breakdown analysis (ABA) is an inexpensive alternative to the breakdown 
simulations performed with the drift-diffusion or hydrodynamic transport models. 
Its main advantages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is fast and less memory and CPU expensive, since it requires only the Poisson equation 
to be solved.</li>
<li>Predicts breakdown trends in the case of doping and geometry variations.</li>
<li>Has no problem with floating semiconductor regions.</li>
<li>Tolerates coarse grids.</li>
<li>Can be used in combination with the drift-diffusion or hydrodynamic carrier transport models.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, its applicability is limited by the following factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>This method considers constant quasi-Fermi potentials. Therefore, 
it can be applied only to (quasi-)equilibrium conditions assuming no 
current flow. This limits ABA to off-state and low-current condition 
device simulations only.</li>
<li>This method usually underestimates a breakdown because phenomena such as 
carrier recombination, tunneling, surface scattering, and high-field carrier 
velocity saturation are not accounted for.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11.3.5 Ionization Integral Path Search Options</h2>

<p>Depending 
on the details of the device design, it is generally not known which ionization path 
will contribute the most to breakdown. Therefore, Sentaurus Device offers different 
strategies to generate the initial set of elements from which the path search starts. 
The strategy is selected by one of the options to the <tt>ComputeIonizationIntegrals</tt> 
section:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>ComputeAtMaxElectricField</tt>:<br /> 
The path search starts from the element having the maximal electric field within 
a semiconductor region. This method is the fastest since only one path is evaluated 
at every bias point, but it is also the least accurate. In some circumstances, it 
might also miss the path that contributes the most to breakdown.</li>

<li><tt>ComputeAtMaxElectricField(delta=&lt;value&gt;)</tt>:<br />
All elements within a semiconductor region, where the electric field exceeds the 
maximal electric field minus <tt>delta</tt>, are taken into the initial element list. 
This is the default option with <tt>delta=1e4</tt> V/cm.</li>

<li><tt>MinElectricField=&lt;value&gt;</tt>: <br />
All elements within a semiconductor region, where the electric field is higher than 
<tt>MinElectricField</tt>, are taken into the initial element list. 
<tt>MinElectricField</tt> is given in V/cm. A recommended value is approximately 
250&nbsp;kV/cm.</li>

<li><tt>ComputeAll</tt>:<br />
All elements within a semiconductor region are taken into the initial element list. 
This method can result in excessive computation time in structures with a large number 
of elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the electric field&ndash;based restrictions for the initial element search,
geometric restrictions can be imposed by specifying a <tt>Window</tt> 
in the <tt>ComputeIonizationIntegrals</tt> section. Only elements with center positions within the specified
geometric shapes defined in <tt>Window</tt> are considered for the path search. You can specify the following
geometric shapes:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Cuboid(corner1=&lt;vector&gt; corner2=&lt;vector&gt;)</tt>:
   <tt>corner1</tt> and <tt>corner2</tt> are the diagonally opposite corners of the cuboid.</li>
<li><tt>Sphere(center=&lt;vector&gt; radius=&lt;float&gt;)</tt>:
   <tt>center</tt> is the vector to the center of the sphere, and <tt>radius</tt> is the radius 
of the sphere.</li>
<li><tt>Cylinder(center1=&lt;vector&gt; center2=&lt;vector&gt; radius=&lt;float&gt;)</tt>:
   <tt>center1</tt> and <tt>center2</tt> are vectors to the circular bases of the cylinder, 
and <tt>radius</tt> is the radius of the bases of the cylinder.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">While the ionization path must start from an element within the <tt>Window</tt>, 
the path itself can extend beyond the geometric element.</p>

<p>The ionization path will stop when the electric field becomes too small and no longer 
contributes to the ionization integral. This value (default 1 V/cm) can be adjusted with the 
<tt>PathSearchStopField</tt> parameters in the <tt>ComputeIonizationIntegrals</tt> 
section.</p>

<!--====================-->
<h2>11.3.6 Boundary Conditions for ABA Method</h2>

<p>By default, the ABA method follows the same boundary conditions specified for the 
device solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>The default boundary condition in Sentaurus Device is reflective BC. As such, the 
ionization path will also be reflected when it reaches a domain boundary. This can be 
switched off with the <tt>-PathReflection()</tt> keyword in the <tt>ComputeIonizationIntegrals</tt> 
section. It is also possible to have the ionization path reflected at other interfaces
by using one of the following options to <tt>PathReflection</tt>:<br />
 <ul>
 <li><tt>ReflectAtMaterial=&lt;material&gt;</tt>: The path is reflected at the interface to the defined materials. Elements inside the specified materials are excluded from the initial element list.</li>
 <li><tt>ReflectAtRegion=&lt;region&gt;</tt>: The path is reflected at the interface to the defined regions. Elements inside the specified regions are excluded from the initial element list.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>If periodic boundary conditions are specified in Sentaurus Device, then the ABA method will 
also use periodic BCs, and the path wraps around the domain boundary where the periodic BCs are 
specified.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Periodic boundary conditions and path reflection cannot be used simultaneously. 
Therefore, path reflection is switched off automatically if periodic boundary conditions are used.</p>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>11.4 Ionization Integrals With Carriers Analysis</h1>

<p>Ionization integrals with carriers (IIC) analysis follows the concept of ABA by 
computing the ionization integrals along a bias sweep, but quantitatively it is more 
precise than ABA because it solves the entire system of carrier transport equations 
and computes the ionization integrals in a postprocessing mode based on a given 
driving force specification for the avalanche model.</p>

<p>At the same time, the corresponding avalanche generation rates are excluded 
from the carrier continuity equations, even if the model is activated in the 
<tt>Physics</tt> section, and the decision when to stop a simulation is defined 
by either the given <tt>Goal</tt> value (see <a href="#IonSolve">Section 11.4.4 Solve Section</a>) 
or the <tt>BreakAtIonIntegral</tt> criterion (see <a href="#IonMath">Section 11.4.3 Math Section</a>).</p>

<p>Such an approach can be applied to a large number of electrical breakdown simulation 
tasks, including 3D device  simulations.</p>

<p>The same <tt>Electrode</tt> section description is used for IIC analysis as for ABA.</p>

<a name="BVextra"></a>
<h2>11.4.5 Breakdown Voltage Extraction</h2>

<p>The breakdown voltage is estimated by looking at the avalanche current component,
which is computed from the integral value of the avalanche generation rate, plotted
according to the statement provided in the <tt>CurrentPlot</tt> section
(see <a href="#CurPlot">Section 11.4.2 CurrentPlot Section</a>). For each bias condition, 
the avalanche generation current is computed. The point where its value exceeds 
the value of the conduction current is recognized as a breakdown point (see Figure 2).</p>

curve shows the conduction current, directly computed by Sentaurus Device. The 
red curve indicates the portion of the current due to the avalanche generation 
only, computed in a postprocessing step. The breakdown is estimated as a point 
where these two currents meet. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<h1>11.5 External Resistor Method</h1>

<p>A simple but effective way to switch from a prebreakdown voltage-controlled sweep to a 
postbreakdown current-controlled sweep is to attach an appropriate resistor to an electrode. 
The resistor value should be large enough such that, in the postbreakdown regime, most of the 
applied voltage drops across the resistor. The combination of the resistor + voltage 
source then acts effectively as a current source.</p>
      
<p>A simple way to establish the value of the resistor is to make a test run without an 
external resistor. In general, the simulation fails to converge near the onset of breakdown 
or shortly after. Divide the applied voltage by the obtained electrode current and use a 
resistor value of the order of <tt>V/I</tt>.</p>

<p>For most breakdown simulation tasks, the external resistor method provides
the most reliable solution and can be recommended, despite its tendency to be 
the slowest of all the methods discussed in this section.</p>

<p class="note">When plotting the resulting I&ndash;V curve from the external resistor method, 
use the <tt>InnerVoltage</tt> value as an argument to obtain the pure voltage drop on a simulated

<h1>11.6 Voltage-to-Current Boundary Condition Switching Method</h1>

<p>As an alternative to the external resistor method to simulate a device 
electrical breakdown, you can use the voltage-to-current method, which applies 
the boundary condition (BC) switch from the voltage BC (Dirichlet) to the 
current BC (Neumann).</p>

<p>When specifying the switching point, you must ensure that beyond this point the
current increases monotonically as shown in Figure&nbsp;3. Otherwise, the method
fails. Note, however, that the voltage can decrease again (snapback).</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. For monotonic curve (red), the voltage-to-current BC 
switching method can be applied to any bias point. For nonmonotonic curve (black), 
showing negative differential resistance behavior, the voltage-to-current BC 
switching method can be applied only to the indicated bias, where the current 
starts to grow monotonically. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<h1>11.7 Continuation Method</h1>

<p>The continuation method enables automated tracing of arbitrarily shaped curves 
such as breakdown or latch-up. Its implementation is based on a dynamic load-line technique 
adapting the boundary conditions along the traced curve to ensure convergence.</p>

<p>Because the curve derivative computation is involved in the continuation
method, sometimes it can show less stable convergence behavior, compared to the
external resistor method or the voltage-to-current BC switching method.</p>

<p>Without user intervention, an external load resistor is connected to a 
device electrode at which the curve is traced and, therefore, the device 
is indirectly biased through the load resistance. By monitoring the slope 
of a traced curve, an optimal BC is determined by adjusting the load line 
so that it is orthogonal to the local tangent of the curve. The continuation method 
automatically decides on a BC without prior knowledge of the curve characteristics.</p>

<h1>11.8 Transient Method</h1>

<p>In some situations, for example, with a floating semiconductor region present inside 
a simulated structure or when the dynamic trap occupation by electrons or holes is 
considered, it is required that a device simulation is performed in transient.</p>

<p>The following sections show how to perform a transient device breakdown simulation 
for a 2D NMOSFET device.</p>

<!--====================-->
<h2>11.8.1 Electrode Section</h2>

<p>In certain cases, having a device bias ramped in the time domain helps to achieve 
faster and more reliable results for a device breakdown simulation. To do this, time-dependent 
boundary conditions are used for a specific electrode (drain electrode in this case), with 
a given list of voltage&ndash;time pairs. The initial boundary condition in this case is 
still defined by a separate &quot;static&quot; voltage whose value is used to compute the 
initial guess solution.</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods/BV_des.cmd" header="Electrode {" startExpr="*drain*" startoccurrence=2 lines=1" -->
<pre>
Electrode {
  { Name=&quot;drain&quot; Voltage=0.0 Voltage=(0. at 0., _Vdd_ at _tend_) Resistor= 1e7 }
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods/BV_des.cmd" startExpr="*source*" endExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
  { Name=&quot;source&quot;    Voltage=0.0 }
  { Name=&quot;gate&quot;      Voltage=0.0 Barrier= -0.55 }
  { Name=&quot;substrate&quot; Voltage=0.0 }
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Here, the first voltage&ndash;time pair defines the initial condition from where the 
transient starts. The second pair, <tt>_Vdd_ at _tend_</tt>, defines the final time 
and the goal bias to be reached. Between these, as many voltage&ndash;time pairs as needed can be
specified, thereby allowing a complex piecewise bias transient ramp to be simulated.</p>

<!--====================-->
<h2>11.8.2 Math Section</h2>

<p>Simulations in transient require discretization of the transient equations. Two transient 
discretization schemes are supported in Sentaurus Device: simple backward Euler (BE) method 
and composite trapezoidal rule/backward differentiation formula (TRBDF) method.</p>

<p>The composite TRBDF method, a second-order approximation, is used by default in 
Sentaurus Device. On the other hand, in most cases, the BE method, despite its lower 
accuracy, is suggested as the method of choice to solve most standard simulation tasks 
in transient, due to its better performance compared to the composite TRBDF method.</p>

<p> To activate the BE method, use:</p>

<pre>
Math {
...
  Transient= BE
}
</pre>

<p>The same break criterion, as used in the external resistor method, is used here 
to terminate the simulation when the given current level is reached.</p>

<p>For all of these methods, linear solution extrapolation is used, which helps to 
speed up the convergence on a single Newton iteration. However, this is not 
always the case for transient simulations. The decision to apply or not apply the solution 
extrapolation can be made individually for each particular case, by switching on or off 
the <tt>Extrapolate</tt> keyword in the <tt>Math</tt> section of the command file.</p>

<!--====================-->
<h2>11.8.3 Solve Section</h2>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods/BV_des.cmd" startExpr="Solve*" startoccurrence=5 endExpr="}*" -->

  ) { Coupled { _EQUATIONSET_ } }
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Remembering that a large external lumped resistor is attached to the drain 
electrode, the <tt>_Vdd_</tt> bias is defined as:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods/BV_des.cmd" {" startExpr="*_Vdd_*" startoccurrence=1 lines=1" -->
<pre>
#define _Vdd_ 100000.
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The <tt>_tend_</tt> value defines how fast the drain bias is ramped in time 
and is defined in seconds:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods/BV_des.cmd" {" startExpr="*_tend_*" startoccurrence=1 lines=1" -->
<pre>
#define _tend_ 1.
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The <tt>Transient</tt> keyword indicates that the simulation should be performed in 
transient. All time-related parameter values are given in seconds. Computations performed 
for <tt>InitialStep</tt>, <tt>MinStep</tt>, and <tt>MaxStep</tt> values reflect the fact 
that a large lumped resistor is attached to the drain electrode, and a large bias is 
applied to the drain electrode accordingly.</p>

<p class="note">When plotting the resulting I&ndash;V curve from the transient method, 
use the drain <tt>InnerVoltage</tt> value as an argument to obtain the pure voltage 
drop on a simulated device under investigation.</p>

<p>The additional displacement current component 
\(\bo J_{\bo D} = \bo ε_{\bo 0} · {\bo δ \bo E} / {\bo δ \bo t} \)
is computed in transient, which contributes to the integral current value.
Therefore, with the faster ramp times, you might expect different results
obtained in transient, compared to a steady-state solution. In general, you
should double-check whether a certain ramp time value satisfies the task
requirement.</p>

<p>However, in this particular example, the breakdown value is not affected by the 
ramp speed, as shown in Figure&nbsp;6.</p>

<h1>11.9 Tracking Additional Data in the Current File</h1>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="#CurPlot">Section&nbsp;11.4.2 CurrentPlot Section</a>, 
the top-level <tt>CurrentPlot</tt> statement provides a way to write additional 
scalar data to the current file. Data depending on coordinates can be written.</p>

<p>When writing coordinate-dependent data, the values are interpolated as required. 
For example, the maxima of the electric field and the impact ionization, and their
respective coordinates, can be written to the <tt>.plt</tt> file with:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/BVmethods/BV_des.cmd" startExpr="CurrentPlot*" startoccurrence=2 endExpr="*}*" -->
<pre>
CurrentPlot {
  ImpactIonization(Maximum(Semiconductor Coordinates))
  ElectricField   (Maximum(Semiconductor Coordinates))
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>This capability is used in the electrical breakdown simulation in 
<a href="#8">Section&nbsp;11.8 Transient Method</a>. Figure&nbsp;8 shows the 
maximum of the electric field and the maximum of the impact ionization, 
depending on time.</p>

<p><a href="images/sd_max_E.png"><img src="images/sd_max_E.png" width="450"

<p class="caption">Figure 8. Maximum of the electric field (left axis) and the 
impact ionization (right axis) versus time. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is possible to output averages, integrals, maximum, and
minimum of quantities over specified domains. To do this, specify the keyword 
<tt>Average</tt>, <tt>Integrate</tt>, <tt>Maximum</tt>, or <tt>Minimum</tt>,
respectively, followed by the specification of the domain in parentheses.</p>

<p>A domain can be a region, a material, region and material interfaces, a window 
(given by coordinates), a doping well, or any of <tt>Semiconductor</tt>, 
<tt>Insulator</tt>, or <tt>Everywhere</tt>. For example, avalanche 
generation can be integrated over the silicon material with:</p>

<pre>
CurrentPlot {

<h1>11.10 Driving Force for Avalanche Generation and High-Field Saturation Models</h1>

<p>Since the process of avalanche generation depends exponentially on the 
driving force that causes it, Sentaurus Device provides many options for choosing 
the appropriate driving force model for avalanche generation and also for 
high-field saturation (HFS) models. The driving force for avalanche generation 
affects breakdown behavior directly; whereas, the driving force choice for HFS models
affects the behavior after breakdown, since the current density in power devices 
is limited by velocity saturation.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<h2>11.10.1 Driving Force for Avalanche Generation</h2>

<p>For avalanche generation, Sentaurus Device offers the following driving forces:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> is the default and uses the magnitude of the gradient of 
<tt>eQuasiFermi</tt> or <tt>hQuasiFermi</tt> as the driving force.</li>
<li><tt>EParallel</tt> uses the electric field in the direction of the electron or hole current 
as the driving force.</li>
<li><tt>ElectricField</tt> is used only for approximate breakdown analysis (see 
<a href="#3">Section&nbsp;11.3 Approximate Breakdown Analysis</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The driving force for the avalanche model is chosen as following:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Recombination(
    Avalanche( &lt;drivingforce&gt; )
  )
}
</pre>

<p>When the carrier density is small, the direction of the current vector cannot be well 
established numerically, leading to large fluctuations in the driving force field. This 
can result in sudden changes in avalanche generation and, therefore, leads to convergence 
problems.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<h2>11.10.2 Driving Force for Velocity High-Field Saturation Models</h2>

<p>For velocity high-field saturation (HFS), Sentaurus Device offers the following 
driving forces:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> is the default and uses the magnitude of the gradient of 
<tt>eQuasiFermi</tt> or <tt>hQuasiFermi</tt> as the driving force.</li>
<li><tt>EParallel</tt> uses the electric field in the direction of the electron or hole 
current as the driving force.</li>
<li><tt>ElectricField</tt> uses the magnitude of the electric field as the driving force.</li>
<li><tt>EParallelToInterface</tt> uses the electric field component parallel to the 
nearest interface as the driving force.</li>
<li><tt>SqrtEfieldProdGQF</tt> uses the square root of the electric field multiplied by 
the gradient of the quasi-Fermi level as the driving force.</li>
</ul>

<p>The driving force is chosen in the <tt>Physics</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Mobility(
    HighFieldSaturation( &lt;drivingforce&gt; )
  )
}
</pre>

<p>As with avalanche generation, <tt>EParallel</tt> is the most physically accurate model, 
but it suffers from the same stability problems. <tt>ElectricField</tt> overestimates the 
driving force in the channel of a MOS device, since the perpendicular electric field is 
also taken into account. For MOS channels, <tt>EParallelToInterface</tt> is a better model, 
because the current flows primarily parallel to the metal&ndash;insulator interface. However, 
at rounded trench corners where breakdown can occur, this model underestimates the driving 
force, because there the current flow becomes primarily perpendicular to the interface. 
As such, <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> offers the best balance between accuracy and robustness 
in terms of the choice of driving force model.</p>

<p>Note that the choice of the driving force for velocity HFS will have little or no 
impact on the breakdown voltage (the point where breakdown starts), but it can 
significantly affect snapdown behavior. Therefore, a careful driving force choice is 
needed only when snapdown behavior is of interest.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<h2>11.10.3 Driving Force Interpolation for Velocity High-Field Saturation and Avalanche Models</h2>

<p>Even though <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> offers the best choice for the driving force for 
HFS models, due to its mathematical nature, it can show instabilities in areas of 
low-carrier concentration. To overcome these instabilities, Sentaurus Device can be 
instructed to interpolate from <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> to a different driving force model.</p>

<p>The possibility to interpolate a given avalanche driving force to the electric field 
at low carrier concentrations, similar to what is described in 
<a href="../sd/sd_9.html#nonlin">Section&nbsp;9.3.2 Nonlinear Solver Controls</a>, is 
available in Sentaurus Device. It can sometimes improve the simulator convergence behavior.</p>

<p>For the <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> driving force, the following syntax should be used 
to interpolate it to the <tt>ElectricField</tt> within regions of small carrier densities:</p>

<pre>
Math {
  RefDens_eGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField_Aval = &lt;refdens&gt;
  RefDens_hGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField_Aval = &lt;refdens&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>where <tt>&lt;refdens&gt;</tt> is the electron or hole concentration below which this 
interpolation becomes active.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the <tt>EParallel</tt> driving force is used as a driving force,
then it can also be interpolated to the <tt>ElectricField</tt> using the following syntax:</p> 

<pre>
Math {
  RefDens_eEParallel_ElectricField_Aval = &lt;refdens&gt;
  RefDens_hEParallel_ElectricField_Aval = &lt;refdens&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>Using these specifications, the driving force interpolation is applied to the 
avalanche term only.</p>

<p>The driving force interpolation for the velocity high-field saturation model can be
applied separately. Different options are available. The first option is to interpolate 
from <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> to <tt>ElectricField</tt>:</p>

<pre>
Math {
  RefDens_eGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField_HFS = &lt;refdens&gt;
  RefDens_hGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField_HFS = &lt;refdens&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>where <tt>&lt;refdens&gt;</tt> is the electron or hole concentration below which this 
interpolation becomes active.</p>

<p>The second option is to interpolate from <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> to 
<tt>EParallelToInterface</tt>:</p>

<pre>
Math {
  RefDens_eGradQuasiFermi_EParallelToInterface_HFS = &lt;refdens&gt;
  RefDens_hGradQuasiFermi_EParallelToInterface_HFS = &lt;refdens&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>Lastly, there is an option to interpolate from <tt>EParallel</tt> to 
<tt>ElectricField</tt>, just like for avalanche generation:</p>

<pre>
Math {
  RefDens_eEParallel_ElectricField_HFS = &lt;refdens&gt;
  RefDens_hEParallel_ElectricField_HFS = &lt;refdens&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>Which of these interpolation options is appropriate for the given structure depends 
on whether the breakdown behavior occurs primarily in the channel or at a trench corner. 
In the first case, interpolation to <tt>EParallelToInterface</tt> is more accurate; 
whereas in the latter case, interpolation to <tt>ElectricField</tt> is more accurate.</p>

<p>If no prior information is available about the breakdown location, then  the following setup 
is recommended for a typical power device:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Recombination(
    Avalanche( GradQuasiFermi )
  )
  Mobility(
    HighFieldSaturation( GradQuasiFermi )
  )
}
Math {
  RefDens_eGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField_HFS = 1e12
  RefDens_hGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField_HFS = 1e12
}
</pre>
