<h1>2.1 Overview</h1>

<p>This section introduces various carrier transport models, namely, drift-diffusion, 
thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and Monte Carlo transport, as well as quantum transport, 
based on the density gradient model. These models are applied in different situations 
depending on the requirement of the application.</p>

<p>All Sentaurus Device command files are featured in a complete Sentaurus 
Workbench project in the directory 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels</tt>.</p>

<p>In this project, three typical MOSFET device characteristics &ndash; transfer 
(I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>gs</sub>), output (I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>ds</sub>), and
off-state breakdown &ndash; are simulated with different carrier transport models. 
In addition, the effect of carrier quantization in the transistor channel is demonstrated.</p>

<p>To run the project, copy it into a directory that resides under the Sentaurus Workbench 
working directory to which the environment variable <tt>$STDB</tt> points. For details 
about this environment variable, see 
<a href="../swb/swb_01.html#2">Section&nbsp;1.2 Starting Sentaurus Workbench</a>.</p>

<p>After copying the project, open it in Sentaurus Workbench by choosing 
<strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Open</strong> or double-clicking the project icon.</p>

<p>The project uses Sentaurus Workbench features discussed in the 
<a href="../swb/swb_menu.html">Sentaurus Workbench module</a> as well as in 
<a href="../sd/sd_10.html">Section&nbsp;10. Running Sentaurus Device in Sentaurus Workbench</a>.
To view the preprocessed command file for each individual transport model, highlight the 
corresponding node and choose <strong>Extensions</strong> &gt;

<p>The FinFET device simulation using the Monte Carlo approach is discussed in
<a href="#3">Section&nbsp;2.3 Monte Carlo Transport</a>.</p>

<h1>2.2 MOSFET Device Simulation With Different Carrier Transport Models</h1>

<p>A MOSFET electrical device simulation with three different carrier transport models 
is considered in the <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels</tt> 
project:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>drift-diffusion model</em> (DD) solves self-consistently the Poisson and 
the carrier continuity equations in the designated device regions with specified boundary 
conditions.</li>
<li>The <em>thermodynamic model</em> (Thermo) extends the drift-diffusion approach to 
account for electrothermal effects under the assumption that charge carriers are 
in thermal equilibrium with the lattice. In practice, it solves the lattice temperature 
(heat flow) equation in addition to the Poisson equation and the carrier continuity equations.</li>
<li>The <em>hydrodynamic model</em> (HD) solves the carrier temperature and the heat flow 
equations in addition to the Poisson and the carrier continuity equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Sentaurus Workbench project shown in Figure 1, to activate a particular 
transport model, the parameter <tt>tmodel</tt> is introduced, whose value decides which 
model to use. In addition, carrier quantization can be switched on or off for each 
transport model in use, by setting the corresponding value of the project parameter <tt>QC</tt>.</p>

<h2>2.2.1 Drift-Diffusion Transport Model</h2>

<p>The drift-diffusion transport model is the default in Sentaurus Device. Therefore, 
no special keyword is needed to activate the model, which can be applied to arbitrary 
device simulations, such as MOSFETs and BJTs.</p>

<p>The typical <tt>Physics</tt> section for MOSFET device simulations with 
the drift-diffusion model is:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
   Fermi
   EffectiveIntrinsicDensity( OldSlotboom )     
   Mobility(
      DopingDep
      eHighFieldsaturation( GradQuasiFermi )
      hHighFieldsaturation( GradQuasiFermi )
      Enormal
   )
   Recombination(
      SRH( DopingDep TempDependence )
   )           
}
</pre>

<p>Here, the <tt> Fermi</tt> keyword activates the carrier Fermi statistics.</p>

<p>The <tt>EffectiveIntrinsicDensity</tt> statement triggers the bandgap 
narrowing effect in highly doped regions using the <tt>OldSlotboom</tt> model, 
which directly affects the calculation of the intrinsic carrier density in silicon.</p>

<p>The <tt>Mobility</tt> statement defines the carrier mobility models, which include 
electron or hole mobility degradation due to high doping (<tt>DopingDep</tt>), 
carrier velocity saturation for regions with a high electric field 
(<tt>eHighFieldsaturation</tt> or <tt>hHighFieldsaturation</tt>), 
and mobility degradation at semiconductor&ndash;insulator interfaces (<tt>Enormal</tt>). 
The <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> driving force for the high-field saturation (HFS) 
model is used for both carrier velocities.</p>

<p>In addition, doping- and temperature-dependent Shockley&ndash;Read&ndash;Hall 
(SRH) recombination is activated within the <tt>Recombination</tt> statement.</p> 

<p>The set of drift-diffusion model equations to be solved includes the Poisson 
equation and the carrier continuity equations for electrons and holes. Typically, these 
equations are solved self-consistently using the <tt>Coupled</tt> statement inside 
the <tt>Solve</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Solve {
  ...
  Coupled {Poisson Electron Hole}
  ...
}
</pre>

<!--========================-->
<a name="Thermo"></a>
<h2>2.2.2 Thermodynamic Transport Model</h2>

<p>The thermodynamic transport model is required in case considerable self-heating 
occurs. This includes device operations under high current condition, such as on-state 
MOSFET or open bipolar device operations. In these regimes, within high-current 
regions, considerable Joule heat is produced, which leads to a significant rise in the 
lattice temperature.</p>

<p>Most transport model coefficients, such as carrier mobility and 
generation&ndash;recombination, are functions of the lattice temperature. Therefore, 
having the correct lattice temperature distribution is necessary to correctly predict 
the electrical device behavior.</p>

<p>To activate the model, you must specify <tt>Thermodynamic</tt> in the 
<tt>Physics</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Thermodynamic
  ...
  Recombination(
      SRH( DopingDep TempDependence )
  )           
}
</pre>

<p>For most of the models (such as carrier mobility), the lattice temperature dependency
is taken into account by default. For others such as temperature dependency of SRH lifetimes,
it should be activated explicitly.</p>

<p>The heat transport simulations require the heat boundary conditions to be specified 
in the command file, which is done in the <tt>Thermode</tt> section where thermodes
(thermal electrodes) are defined with the temperature boundary condition assigned to them:</p>

<pre>
Thermode{ 
  { Name=&quot;top_thermode&quot; Temperature=300 } 
  { Name=&quot;substrate&quot; Temperature=300 SurfaceResistance=5e-4 } 
}
</pre>

<p>A thermal contact can coincide with an electrode or can be defined as a separate contact. 
For each thermal contact, a temperature must be declared. The contact can be attached to a material 
by a thermal resistor, whose value is specified by the <tt>SurfaceResistance</tt> keyword.
This often helps to emulate the realistic layer thermal resistivity without having the full layer
included in the simulated device structure. The unit of such a resistor is cm<sup>2</sup>K/W.</p>

<p>Without a thermal resistor, the contact is kept always at the declared temperature. 
Note that, at the external device boundaries without a thermode, the reflective boundary 
condition (zero heat flow) is applied by default.</p>

<p>The keyword <tt>Temperature</tt> inside the <tt>Coupled</tt> statement specifies 
that the lattice heat equation should be solved self-consistently with the drift-diffusion 
transport equations. As a result, the nonuniformly distributed lattice temperature 
profile can be seen inside the device:</p>

<pre>
Solve {
   Coupled{ Poisson Electron Hole Temperature }
}
</pre>

<p>To plot the resulting heat-related quantities, corresponding dataset names must 
be placed in the <tt>Plot</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Plot {
...
*--Heat quantities 
   Temperature TotalHeat eJouleHeat hJouleHeat
}
</pre>

<!--========================-->
<a name="HD"></a>
<h2>2.2.3 Hydrodynamic Transport Model</h2>

<p>The hydrodynamic transport model solves the carrier temperature and the lattice heat
equations in addition to the Poisson and the carrier continuity equations.</p>

<p>The essentials of the hydrodynamic transport model are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The model is especially useful in simulating deep-submicron and heterostructure
devices. It allows nonlocal effects to be included in the simulation, such as 
velocity overshoot, which can drastically alter device performance.</li>

<li>For a device breakdown simulation, the use of the hydrodynamic transport 
model avoids the onset of premature breakdowns  due to the local field, assumed 
in the drift-diffusion model.</li>

<li>Hydrodynamic carrier transport is used typically for heterostructure device 
simulations where the energy transport across heterointerfaces plays an important role.</li>
</ul>

<p>To activate the model, you must specify <tt>Hydrodynamic</tt> in the 
<tt>Physics</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Hydrodynamic
  ...
   Mobility(
      DopingDep
      HighFieldsaturation( CarrierTempDrive )
      Enormal
   )
}
</pre>

<p class="note">If you use <tt>HighFieldSaturation</tt>, avalanche, or the classical 
lucky electron model, then you should activate carrier temperature as the driving 
force for self-consistency.</p>

<p>To solve the electron or hole carrier energy and lattice heat equations self-consistently 
with carrier transport, the keywords <tt>eTemperature</tt>, <tt>hTemperature</tt>, 
and <tt>Temperature</tt> must be added to the solved equation set in the <tt>Coupled</tt> 
statement:</p>

<pre>
Solve {
   Coupled{ Poisson Electron Hole eTemperature hTemperature Temperature }
}
</pre>

<p>If only one carrier temperature equation must be solved, <tt>Hydrodynamic</tt> 
must be specified with the appropriate parameter, either <tt>Hydrodynamic(eTemperature)</tt> 
or <tt>Hydrodynamic(hTemperature)</tt>:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Hydrodynamic(eTemperature)
  ...
   Mobility(
      DopingDep
      eHighFieldsaturation( CarrierTempDrive )
      hHighFieldsaturation( GradQuasiFermi )
      Enormal
   )
}
</pre>

<p>With the above definitions, only the electron carrier transport is simulated 
using the hydrodynamic transport model, while the hole transport is simulated 
using the drift-diffusion transport model.</p>

<p>The qualifier <tt>CarrierTempDrive</tt> in the <tt>eHighFieldsaturation</tt> 
statement activates the carrier temperature as a driving force for electrons in 
the high-field saturation model. For holes, the <tt>GradQuasiFermi</tt> 
driving force is used.</p>

<p>If only single-carrier energy transport is considered, such as in the previous 
<tt>Physics</tt> section, one of the keywords (<tt>hTemperature</tt> in this case) 
can be omitted. In addition, to deactivate the effect of lattice heating, the 
lattice heat equation, activated with the <tt>Temperature</tt> keyword, must not 
be included in the equation set inside the <tt>Coupled</tt> statement:</p>

<pre>
Solve {
   Coupled{ Poisson Electron Hole eTemperature }
}
</pre>

<p>To plot the resulting quantities, corresponding dataset names must be placed 
in the <tt>Plot</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Plot {
   ...
   Temperature eTemperature hTemperature
}
</pre>

<a name="QC"></a>
<h2>2.2.4 Carrier Quantization With Density Gradient Model</h2>

<p>The density gradient (DG) model, in addition to the Schr&ouml;dinger carrier 
quantization model, provides the most physically accurate solution and can be 
recommended as the model of choice to account for carrier quantization effects 
in transistor channels and at heterointerfaces.</p>

<p>In the DG approximation, the quantum potential is a function of the carrier 
densities and their gradients, which requires the self-consistent quantum 
potential and the carrier transport equations solution. The DG model can be 
applied to 2D and 3D device simulations.</p>

<p>The keywords <tt>eQuantumPotential</tt> and <tt>hQuantumPotential</tt> activate
the DG model for electrons and holes, respectively. If a transistor operates under 
a channel inversion regime, only quantum correction for minority carriers (electrons) 
can be considered to reduce the task complexity:</p>

<pre>
Physics{
   eQuantumPotential 
   ...
}
</pre>

<p>To solve the electron quantum-potential equation, you must include the 
<tt>eQuantumPotential</tt> keyword in the corresponding <tt>Coupled</tt> 
statements:</p>

<pre>
Solve {
  ...
  Coupled{ Poisson Electron Hole eQuantumPotential }
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>To plot the quantum-potential profile and related quantum-corrected 
quantities, you must specify them in the <tt>Plot</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
Plot{
   eDensity 
   BandGap BandGapNarrowing Affinity ConductionBand ValenceBand
   eQuantumPotential
}

<h2>2.2.5 Transfer (I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>gs</sub>) MOSFET Device Simulation</h2>

<p>In this file, the model selector, the set of transport equations, and the 
driving force for the velocity saturation in the high electric field model are 
decided according to a value of the project parameter <tt>tmodel</tt>:</p>

</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>To switch on the DG model to account for carrier quantization in the channel, 
the value of the <tt>QC</tt> project parameter is checked out:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels/IdVgs_des.cmd" startExpr="#-* quantum*" endExpr="#endif" -->

</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The applied drain bias and the initial gate bias conditions are defined explicitly
using the Sentaurus Workbench <tt>#define</tt> command:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels/IdVgs_des.cmd" startExpr="#define _Vdd_*" endExpr="#define _Vginit_*" -->
<pre>
#define _Vdd_     1.1
#define _Vginit_  -1.
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>For simulations with the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic transport models, 
at least one thermal contact must be specified in the <tt>Thermode</tt> section, 
where a thermal boundary condition is defined:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels/IdVgs_des.cmd" startExpr="Thermode*" endExpr="*}*" footer="  ...\n}" -->
<pre>
Thermode{ 
  { Name=&quot;substrate&quot; Temperature=300 SurfaceResistance=5e-4 }

</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>There are two <tt>Quasistationary</tt> statements in the <tt>Solve</tt> section. 
The first statement ramps the <tt>drain</tt> voltage from 0&nbsp;V (as defined in the 
<tt>Electrode</tt> section) to a value given by the <tt>_Vdd_</tt> macro definition. 
Similarly, the second statement sweeps the <tt>gate</tt> bias from the initial value 
<tt>_Vginit_</tt> to the value given by the expression <tt>@&lt;2.*_Vdd_&gt;@</tt> (2.2 V):</p>

<!-- grep end -->

<p>Two <tt>NewCurrentPrefix</tt> statements are used to separate the voltage and 
current output files (<tt>*_des.plt</tt>) generated by two quasistationary sweeps.
Each statement produces one file with a unique name and the <tt>.plt</tt> file 
extension, which can be loaded into Sentaurus Visual for visualization.
The given name is extended by a construction, which includes the corresponding project
node number, such that Sentaurus Workbench can distinguish the resulting file if 
it needs to be cleaned up.</p>

<p>At the end of the simulation, one of these files is removed using the <tt>System</tt> 
command call.</p>

<p>The <tt>CurrentPlot</tt> statement ensures that the resulting I&ndash;V curve is 
equidistantly resolved by a given number of intervals, provided in the <tt>Intervals</tt> 
statement. However, internally, Sentaurus Device can compute intermediate steps to 
achieve convergence.</p>

<p>The carrier distributions across the channel, with and without carrier quantization, 
are shown in Figure&nbsp;2 at strong inversion conditions.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. Electron density profile in the center of the channel,

quantization, applied under QC=DG condition, leads to an electron concentration peak

<p>In Figure 3, I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>gs</sub> curves computed with different 
transport models are compared, having carrier quantization switched on or off.
The effect of the current decrease in the device on-state mode is clearly seen in 
the case of the thermodynamic or hydrodynamic transport models, where the electron 
mobility is affected by the lattice heat. For all models taking into account the carrier 
quantization in the channel, a smaller on-state current can be observed due to the 
reduced carrier concentration in the channel.</p>

<h2>2.2.6 Output (I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>ds</sub>) MOSFET Device Simulation</h2>

<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels/IdVds_des.cmd">

<p>Similar settings are used here to simulate the MOSFET I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>ds</sub> 
output characteristic for a given gate bias. The fixed gate bias and the target
drain bias (up to which the drain voltage is swept) are defined explicitly 
using the Sentaurus Workbench <tt>#define</tt> command:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/TransportModels/IdVds_des.cmd" startExpr="#define _Vdd_*" endExpr="#define _Vginit_*" -->

<p>For the drift-diffusion and thermodynamic carrier transport models, the gradient 
of the quasi-Fermi level is used as a driving force for both the 
high-field saturation (HFS) model and the avalanche model.</p>

<p>In the case of the hydrodynamic transport model, the electron carrier energy 
(solution variable) is used to compute the effective field, used as a driving force 
for the HFS and avalanche models (keyword <tt>CarrierTempDrive</tt>). For holes, 
which are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the lattice, the gradient of 
the quasi-Fermi level is used as a driving force.</p>

<p>Several numeric parameters, relevant to the off-state breakdown simulation, 
are used in this project, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>A parameter that controls the driving-force smoothing between the gradient 
of the quasi-Fermi and the electric field (<tt>RefDens_e/hGradQuasiFermi_ElectricField</tt>).</li>
<li>A break criterion that determines at which current level to stop the simulation <br />
(<tt>BreakCriteria{ Current(Contact=&quot;drain&quot; AbsVal=1e-3)</tt>).</li>
<li><tt>DirectQuantumCorrection</tt> specifies to apply the quantum potential correction 
directly to the electrostatic potential as a quantum-mechanical band edge.</li>
<li><tt>RefDens_QuantumPotential=1e12</tt> limits the quantum potential correction 
to densities, higher than the specified reference value. This is helpful for the 
breakdown regime convergence.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute the device off-state breakdown I&ndash;V characteristic, the resistor 
method is used (see <a href="../sd/sd_11.html#5">Section&nbsp;11.5 External Resistor Method</a>). 
Before the breakdown, the device enters the punch-through mode, which is characterized 
by the snapback curve.</p>

<p>Simulations including heat transport (thermodynamic, hydrodynamic) show that 
the device breakdown and postbreakdown behavior are largely affected by the heat. 
Taking into account the carrier quantization in the channel moves the breakdown 
point towards smaller values.</p>

<p>The resulting MOSFET off-state I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>ds</sub> curves

<h1>2.3 Monte Carlo Transport</h1>
 
<p>This section discusses Monte Carlo transport in detail.</p>
 
<!--======================-->
<h2>2.3.1 Surface and Channel Orientation Dependency in PFinFETs</h2>
 
<p>Using the single-particle device Monte Carlo engine in Sentaurus Device, 
a Monte Carlo simulation has two main parts. First, a drift-diffusion 
simulation is run. Second, based on this, a Monte Carlo simulation is 
performed. The drift-diffusion simulation yields an electric field that 
is used in the initial frozen-field simulation of the iteration between 
a Monte Carlo transport simulation and the solution of the Poisson equation.</p>
 
<p>The Monte Carlo simulator integrates these density distributions over 
the entire Monte Carlo window and simulates only the carrier type with 
the greater integral of the density. Furthermore, the single-particle 
device Monte Carlo approach assumes that the integrated density of the
 predominant carrier type is predicted correctly by the drift-diffusion 
simulation. Consequently, compared to a drift-diffusion simulation, a Monte 
Carlo simulation changes only the shape of the electrostatic potential 
and the density distribution, but not the total charge in the Monte Carlo 
window.</p>
 
<p>The simulated 2D geometry is a p-type FinFET device. Figure&nbsp;8 shows 
the top view of the wafer and the doping profile of the structure. The 
channel is undoped. The source and drain regions are p-doped to 
1e20&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup>. The doping drops into the active channel part 
on a Gaussian length scale of 9&nbsp;nm. The gate length is 50&nbsp;nm and 
the fin width is 34.4&nbsp;nm.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. Top view and doping profile of FinFET.

<p>Because of the undoped channel, the quantum-mechanical threshold-voltage 
shift is negligibly small. Therefore, quantum corrections are not considered 
in this project.</p>

<p>The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench 
in the directory <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/MCpFinFET</tt>.</p>
 
<p>As a first step, the device simulation using the drift-diffusion approach is performed
to obtain the electrostatic potential distribution under initial bias conditions.</p>

<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sdevice/MCpFinFET/DD_des.cmd">

<p>After this step, the device state is saved. The obtained solution is used 
to start a Monte Carlo simulation, which is performed in the second Sentaurus 
Device tool instance called <tt>SPMC</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>Normal2OxideDirection = (@surface@)</tt> statement specifies 
that the surface orientation of the PFinFET is parameterized. In this 
project, two orientations are defined for the simulations: (0 1 1) and (0 0 1).</p>
 
<p>The <tt>ChannelDirection = (@channel@)</tt> statement specifies that 
the channel direction of the PFinFET is parameterized. In the (0 1 1) surface 
orientation, three channel directions are defined: <tt>&lt;0 1 -1&gt;</tt>, 
<tt>&lt;1 0 0&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;2 1 -1&gt;</tt>. For the (0 0 1) surface 
orientation, two channel directions are defined: <tt>&lt;1 0 0&gt;</tt> 
and <tt>&lt;-1 1 0&gt;</tt>.</p>
      
<p>Surface roughness scattering is modeled by a combination of 
specular and diffusive scattering. The keyword <tt>SurfScattRatio = 0.85</tt> 
refers to the percentage of specular scattering.</p>
 
<p>The keyword <tt>CurrentErrorBar = 2.0</tt> refers to the 
<em>relative error</em> (in percent) of the drain current, below 
which the simulation stops.</p>
      
<p>The <tt>MinCurrentComput = 10</tt> keyword specifies the minimum

of whether the relative error of the drain current is less than 
<tt>CurrentErrorBar</tt>.</p>
      
<p>The keyword <tt>SelfConsistent(FrozenQF)</tt> defines the Monte Carlo

must be the quasi-Fermi potentials (<tt>QF</tt>).</p>
 
<p>The <tt>Window = Rectangle[(-0.5, -0.1) (0.5, 0.1)]</tt> keyword

<p>The keyword <tt>montecarlo</tt> can be specified at any point in 
the <tt>Solve</tt> section like a partial differential equation. It 
cannot be coupled to any of the partial differential equations, but it 
can be used in quasistationary simulations.</p>
 
<p>Figure 9 shows the Monte Carlo simulation results. The on-state current 
is plotted as a function of the channel direction and the surface orientation. 
It highlights that a (0 1 1) surface orientation coupled with a &lt;1 0 0&gt; 
channel direction is advantageous for PFinFET devices.</p>

<p>This is the consequence of two physical effects:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Specular scattering is determined by the conservation of 
energy and a parallel wavevector. The orientation of the band structure, 
relative to the interface with a (0 1 1) direction, involves a higher 
low-field mobility.</li>
<li>However, high-field transport of holes is enhanced 
for a driving field in the &lt;1 0 0&gt; direction.</li>
