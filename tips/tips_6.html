</ul>

<h1>6.1 What is the impedance field method?</h1>

<p>The random variability of leading-edge transistors is an issue of growing 
concern as transistor scaling continues. With each new technology generation, 
new materials and process steps are introduced to chip manufacturing that affect 
transistor variability. The impedance field method (IFM) is an important tool for 
variability analysis and is available in Sentaurus Device.</p>

<p>The basic concept behind the IFM is to treat randomness as a perturbation 
of a reference device. Rather than solving the full nonlinear Poisson and drift-diffusion 
equations for a large number of random device realizations, you obtain the 3D TCAD 
solution only once for the reference device. Then, you compute the current fluctuations 
at the device terminals caused by these random perturbations. This computation is based 
on linear response theory using a Green's function technique.</p>

<p>For modeling statistical variability, Sentaurus Device supports variants 
of the IFM: noise-like IFM, statistical IFM, and deterministic IFM.</p>

<!--======================-->
<h2>6.1.1 Noise-Like Impedance Field Method</h2>

<p>The noise-like IFM performs noise analysis of semiconductor devices. Its basic concept 
is to establish a model of the noise sources of the device and, for each local fluctuation, 
to evaluate its effect on the device terminals where the output noises are measured. The 
total noise observed on the device terminals is calculated by summing the contribution 
of all the local fluctuations. There are two main steps in performing noise-like IFM 
simulations.</p>

<p>The first step identifies the appropriate microscopic models of the noise sources, 
that is, the local fluctuations inside the device. Depending on the problem and the kind of 
noise of interest, the noise sources could be, for example, fluctuations of the device 
geometry or the dopants inside the device.</p>

<p>The second step determines the impact of the noise sources on the device terminal 
outputs. It is assumed that the terminal voltages and the local fluctuations follow 
linear relationships, which are obtained by computing the Green's function of the terminal 
voltages. When the Green's functions are computed, the total noise on device terminals 
can be readily calculated from the noise sources.</p>

<p>Noise source models related to variability analysis are available for random dopant 
fluctuations, random geometric fluctuations, random trap concentration fluctuations 
(bulk and interface traps), and random workfunction fluctuations.</p>

<!--======================-->
<h2>6.1.2 Statistical Impedance Field Method</h2>

<p>Within the statistical impedance field method (sIFM), you use the Green's function 
to compute the linear current response to actual random perturbation. To obtain 
statistical samples, for example, for random dopant fluctuations, you assume that 
doping is spatially uncorrelated and that the number of dopants in a given volume 
follows a Poisson distribution, with an average given by the average number of dopants 
in the volume.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Device can generate actual random perturbations for any of 
the following quantities under investigation: dopant fluctuations, geometric fluctuations 
(for example, oxide thickness variation and line edge roughness), trap concentration 
fluctuations (bulk and interface traps), workfunction fluctuations, band-edge fluctuations, 
metal conductivity fluctuations, and dielectric constant fluctuations.</p>

<p>You also can include the effects of a random contact resistor attached to the 
drain contact of a MOSFET. The effect of this resistor on the I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>g</sub> 
characteristics can be computed in a postprocessing step with Sentaurus Visual.</p>

<p>For details, see the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Visual User Guide</cite>, Appendix G. 
Specifically, the documentation for the <tt>ifm::GetsIFMStdDev</tt> and 
<tt>ifm::ReadsIFM</tt> procedures.</p>

<p>From the linear current response, you compute the full I&ndash;V curves of the 
randomized devices. The IFM approximates the generally nonlinear system by a linear, 
small-signal, equivalent one. You can improve the accuracy of this inherent 
approximation by leveraging all otherwise available information about the system.</p>

<p>The IFM provides a certain degree of freedom in selecting which linearized quantities 
to consider. For example, for a MOS transistor I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>g</sub> simulation, 
you can consider either the linear gate-voltage response, or the linear drain-current 
response of the system, or a combination of both. For a transistor in saturation, the gate 
voltage only weakly controls the drain current and, therefore, considering the linear 
drain-current response is more appropriate. In the subthreshold regime, on the other hand, 
random fluctuation effects are very well described by threshold voltage fluctuations, 
which are intuitively linked to the linear gate-voltage response. This additional information 
is incorporated into the I&ndash;V computation algorithm by formulating a set of boundary 
conditions specific to the devices and biasing schemes at hand.</p>

<p>An application note <a href="#App1">[App.&nbsp;1]</a> includes examples of 
performing sIFM simulations.</p>

<!--======================-->
<h2>6.1.3 Deterministic Impedance Field Method</h2>

<p>For the deterministic IFM, you specify the variations directly. Instead of using 
doping profile randomizations, you use your own modified doping profile. 
Sentaurus Device computes the effect of the variations on the observation terminal 
voltages and currents. Compared to random fluctuations, deterministic variations give 
you more control over the variation and are easier to understand, because no statistical 
interpretation is required. This method is particularly useful for screening and 
corner analysis.</p>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>6.2 Does IFM analysis require calibration?</h1>

<p>The IFM analysis of random dopant fluctuation (RDF) effects does not require 
any calibration. The amplitude of the RDF effect is proportional to the local doping 
level and is determined automatically. Each doping species contributes to RDF effects 
individually. For example, in an area of a device with compensated doping, the contributions 
from donors and acceptors add rather than subtract.</p>

<p>Comparisons to experimental data and to atomistic simulations show that this 
approach works accurately without the need to calibrate any IFM parameters.</p>

<p>After the traps themselves have been calibrated, no additional calibration 
is needed for the IFM analysis of random trap fluctuation. Similar to RDF, the amplitude 
of the random trap fluctuation effect is determined automatically by the local trap 
concentration.</p>

<p>The models for random geometric fluctuations and random workfunction fluctuations 
offer several use-adjustable parameters that require calibration.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="3"></a> 
<h1>6.3 How does IFM analysis of RDF effects compare to atomistic RDF analysis?</h1>

<p>Accurate atomistic RDF analysis requires 3D simulations because, in a 2D structure, 
each dopant atom becomes a charged rod that runs across the entire channel width, which 
significantly exaggerates the effect. A 3D simulation uses a large number of randomized 
samples. To obtain statistically relevant results, you must use a minimum of 200 
samples. Sometimes 100&thinsp;000 samples are used 
<a href="#ried-2011">[Ref.&nbsp;1]</a>, which constitute a huge computational effort.</p>

<p>In the IFM approach, which can be used in two and three dimensions, the simulation is 
performed only once and takes about twice as long as DC analysis. Therefore, IFM analysis 
can be performed 100 to 50&thinsp;000 times faster than the atomistic approach.</p>

<p>In terms of accuracy, direct comparisons of the IFM and atomistic approaches have shown 
that they result in almost identical threshold variabilities (see, for example, 
<a href="#roy-2011">[Ref.&nbsp;2]</a>) if the comparison is performed correctly.</p>

<p>However, not all of the well-accepted TCAD transport models and parameters are 
directly applicable to atomistic RDF analysis. Many TCAD transport models are specifically 
designed to simulate an &quot;average&quot; device structure with a continuous 
&quot;average&quot; doping profile. When randomizing a doping profile, this 
implicit assumption of smooth doping profiles is violated. For certain TCAD transport 
models, this results in spurious &ndash; and at times very strong &ndash; nonlinearities. 
Therefore, you must carefully select the TCAD transport models you want to use for 
your atomistic simulations <a href="#elsayed-2012">[Ref.&nbsp;3]</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, atomistic simulations do not automatically reproduce the correct average 
(see, for example, <a href="#wong-1993">[Ref.&nbsp;4]</a>). If you use the same TCAD transport 
models and parameters, the threshold voltage of the unperturbed &quot;average&quot; device 
will not correspond to the average of the threshold voltages of the randomized devices. 
Now, you typically have calibrated your TCAD transport models and parameters such that you 
obtain the correct results for the unperturbed &quot;average&quot; device. Therefore, 
you will need to redo this calibration for the atomistic simulations to recover these 
correct results.</p>

<p>With the IFM, first you compute the TCAD solution, then you determine the linear response 
of the TCAD solution to the given perturbation. Consequently, all well-established TCAD 
transport models and all calibrated transport model parameters can be used directly 
for the IFM. In addition, the linearization guarantees by design that, for example, the 
threshold voltage of the unperturbed &quot;average&quot; device will be the same as the 
average of the threshold voltages of the randomized devices.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="4"></a> 
<h1>6.4 Can IFM describe non-Gaussian distributions?</h1>

<p>The noise-like IFM is fast, easy to use, and efficient when it is sufficient to 
know the fluctuation-induced standard deviations of terminal currents and voltages.</p>

<p>The noise-like IFM does not make any assumptions about the actual shape 
of the distribution functions, so a standard deviation can be uniquely defined for 
any distribution function. However, if all you know is the standard deviation, you 
cannot draw any conclusions about possible non-Gaussian distribution tails.</p>

<p>Experimental data published in <a href="#tsunomura-2008">[Ref.&nbsp;5]</a> 
<a href="#song-2011">[Ref.&nbsp;6]</a> exhibits purely Gaussian threshold voltage 
and driving current distributions for a million transistors, which correspond to 
the range of 10 standard deviations &ndash; which raises at least the possibility 
that non-Gaussian behavior observed in certain atomistic simulations might be 
artifacts of the method (see 
<a href="#3">Section&nbsp;6.3 How does IFM analysis of RDF effects compare to atomistic RDF analysis?</a>).</p>

<p>Using the statistical IFM, you can describe the non-Gaussian behavior of 
derived quantities. An example of such a derived quantity is the static noise 
margin of an SRAM cell (see the application note <a href="#App2">[App.&nbsp;2]</a>).</p>

<p>Variability due to surface traps can also show pronounced non-Gaussian
distributions when the average number of traps is low, for example, two. In
this case, it is statistically possible for a given device to have 5 or 6 traps,
but it is impossible to have less than zero traps. Consequently, the distribution must 
be very asymmetric. Such a case is illustrated and discussed in an application note 
<a href="#App1">[App.&nbsp;1]</a>.</p>

<h1>6.5 How do I extract &sigma;(V<sub>t</sub>) and &sigma;(I<sub>d</sub>) from IFM simulation results?</h1>

<p>In typical noise-like IFM simulations for MOSFETs, the noise simulation is run 
at a series of bias points. The noise spectrum of the terminal currents of interest 
is calculated for each bias point. The $V_t$ variation $σ_{Vt}$ can be calculated from 
the noise spectrum in a postprocessing step. For example, when the noise-like IFM is 
applied to an I<sub>d</sub>&ndash;V<sub>g</sub> simulation, the drain current variation 
$σ_{Id}$ is calculated from the drain noise current spectral density $S_{Id}$, which is 
a function of $V_g$:</p>

<p>$$σ_{Id} = √{S_{Id}(V_g) ⋅ 1 \text"Hz"}$$</p>

<p>The calculation of the current variations assumes that the contact voltages remain fixed. 
Assuming fixed drain and gate currents, the gate voltage variation  $σ_{Vg}$ 
can be calculated from the drain noise current spectral density $S_{Id}$ and the 
drain-gate admittance $A_{dg}$:</p>

<p>$$σ_{Vg} = σ_{Id}/A_{dg} = {√{S_{Id}(V_g) ⋅ 1 \text"Hz"}}/A_{dg}$$</p>

<p>The gate-voltage variation is also a function of the gate voltage $V_g$. 
The threshold voltage variation $σ_{Vt}$ is $σ_{Vg}$ at 
$V_g = V_t$, where $V_t$ is the user-defined threshold voltage, 
typically the linear or saturation $V_t$ based on a constant drain-current level. 
The variation of the drain-current $S_{Id}$ is directly available from AC analysis 
results. The relative drain-current variation is:</p>

<p>$$σ_{Id}/I_d = √{S_{Id} ⋅ 1 \text"Hz"}/I_d$$</p>

<p>The drain-current variation is also a function of the gate and drain voltages. A special 
point commonly referred to is the saturation drain-current $I_{d,Sat}$ variation, 
located at $V_g = V_{ds} = V_{dd}$ on this curve. Sometimes, 2D simulation 
structures are used to approximate quasi-3D structures, assuming that the device is 
homogeneous along the third (width) dimension. The <tt>AreaFactor</tt> is set to the device 
width. With 2D simulations, the standard deviations of the 3D devices can be calculated from 
those of the 2D device by the following relations:</p>

<p>
$$\table 
σ_{Vg}^{3\text"D"},=,σ_{Vg}^{2\text"D"}√{1\: \text"μm"} / √w ; 
σ_{Id}^{3\text"D"},=,σ_{Id}^{2\text"D"}√w / √{1\: \text"μm"} ; 
$$
</p>

<p>When the <tt>AreaFactor</tt> ($w$) is set correctly, the standard deviations calculated 
by the IFM are scaled properly according to the above relations.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a> 
<h1>6.6 Which parameters are necessary for oxide thickness variation analysis?</h1>

<p>Two parameters must be provided for oxide thickness variation analysis: the amplitude 
and the correlation length of the oxide thickness fluctuations. The amplitude is usually 
set to the atomic step at the silicon&ndash;oxide interface, which is approximately 0.2&nbsp;nm, 
as can be seen in a TEM in <a href="#niwa-1996">[Ref.&nbsp;7]</a>.</p>

<p>For high-k gate dielectrics, usually a SiO<sub>2</sub> interlayer is used. If the 
simulation structure explicitly contains such an interlayer, the amplitude should be set 
to the atomic step. However, if the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) is used instead, the 
amplitude must be scaled according to the ratio of high-k permittivity to SiO<sub>2</sub> 
permittivity.</p>

<p>The correlation length determines how long are the flat parts of the interface in between 
the atomic steps. A typical correlation length for the silicon&ndash;oxide interface is 
approximately 4&nbsp;nm as can be seen in experimental data shown in 
<a href="#niwa-1996">[Ref.&nbsp;7]</a>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="7"></a> 
<h1>6.7 How do I simulate variation of the gate length of MOSFETs?</h1>

<p>In an actual manufacturing process, when the gate length of a MOSFET varies, 
the liner oxide, the spacers, the source/drain extensions (SDEs), and the deep source/drain 
(SD) regions all vary accordingly, as they are formed in a self-aligned process.</p>

<p>In an IFM simulation, however, this does not happen automatically as the IFM
usually treats all variability sources as statistically independent. It is
possible, however, to correlate different variability sources using the
<tt>RandomField</tt> option. A random field is an abstract, dimensionless, and
normalized amplitude field. It can be used in the form of a multiplication factor in
one or more statistical IFM (sIFM) variability sources.</p>

<p>For gate-length variability or line edge roughness (LER), for example, you would
need to correlate the fluctuations of the side gate edges using the <tt>Geometric</tt> 
option of the sIFM and the fluctuations of the doping profiles using the 
<tt>DopingVariation</tt> option of the sIFM.</p>

<p>For a spacer-patterning process of the gate stack, the spatial fluctuations of
the two gate edges are correlated. For the IFM modeling of this situation, it is
sufficient to define a vectorial shift of both the source-side and drain-side
gate edges, and the corresponding doping profile. Note, however, that in this case, the
LER is typically small and negligible compared to other variability sources.</p>

<p>For direct patterning of the gate stack, the spatial fluctuations of the two
gate edges are uncorrelated. For the IFM modeling of this situation, it is
necessary to separate the source side and the drain side by limiting the
application of the IFM variations to box-shaped regions using the
<tt>SpatialShape</tt>, <tt>SpaceMid</tt>, and <tt>SpaceSig</tt> options. Then, 
you define separate random fields for the source side and the drain side.</p>

<p>As a worse-case scenario, it is also of interest to anticorrelate the spatial 
fluctuations of the two gate edges. In this case, you can use a single random field 
for the source-side and the drain-side areas, and correlate them by defining them 
together in a single <tt>RandomizedVariation</tt> statement, using equal but opposite 
shift vectors.</p>

<p>In particular, for device structures with complicated spacers, it can be
challenging to properly define and correlate the various interfaces involved in
the gate length or LER variability simulation. Note also that the accuracy of the 
results of gate-length variability IFM can be sensitive to meshing. Furthermore, when 
simulating devices with an actually changed gate length, the current as a function of 
amplitude tends to show some nonlinear behavior, which cannot be captured by linear 
response theory. Therefore, it is recommended to validate the IFM setup, the mesh, and 
the applicability by comparing IFM results for a spatially uniform gate-length variation 
with standard TCAD simulation results for device structures with an actually changed gate length.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to modeling gate-length variation is to create a
parameterized simulation structure and to vary the gate length parameter. This method 
ensures that all of the mentioned variation factors are included automatically. Multiple 
gate-length splits can be defined and organized using Sentaurus Workbench.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="8"></a> 
<h1>6.8 How are 2D and 3D simulations handled in the IFM?</h1>

<p>Even when considering a reference device structure that exhibits 2D symmetry 
(extruded devices), the randomization will break the 2D symmetry, and any variability 
analysis must be performed using full 3D TCAD simulations.</p>

<p>Fortunately, when using the IFM, you can use a very efficient hybrid approach. 
For the IFM, you need the Green's function and the randomization. The 
Green's function depends only on the reference device and this retains 2D symmetry, 
while the randomization will almost always exhibit 3D symmetry.</p>

<p>Therefore, if your device structure exhibits 2D symmetry, you can rely on the much 
faster 2D TCAD simulations to compute the DC results as well as the Green's functions. 
The current response to the randomization, however, will be computed in three dimensions. 
For that, the device structure is extruded internally in the third dimension. For some 
variability sources, namely, RDFs, the convolution integral of the Green's function and 
the randomization can be performed analytically in the third dimension, and the 
simulation speed does not depend on the selected device width.</p>

<p>For other variability sources, namely, sources with a finite correlation length, 
the convolution integral must be performed numerically in the third dimension and, 
therefore, the evaluation speed of the convolution integral for an extruded 2D structure 
will be approximately the same as for a real 3D structure and will depend on the selected 
device width.</p>

<p>The device width is set with the keyword <tt>AreaFactor</tt>, which defaults to 
1&nbsp;&micro;m. To activate this hybrid approach, use the keyword <tt>ExtrudeTo3D</tt>. 
This is necessary to model variations correctly with spatial correlations, but it will 
increase the runtime for these variations. Without this keyword, for all variability sources 
with a finite correlation length, the randomization is performed assuming that the 
variations are correlated perfectly in the third spatial direction. The keyword 
<tt>ExtrudeTo3D</tt> has no effect on 3D structures.</p>
