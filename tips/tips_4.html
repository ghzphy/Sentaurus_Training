<h1>4.1 Loading Stress</h1>

<p>In a typical TCAD flow, the stress tensor throughout a device is computed during 
the process simulation and is saved to a TDR file along with the device mesh and other 
quantities such as the doping. Then, Sentaurus Device loads the mesh and doping profile 
by specifying this TDR file for the <tt>Grid</tt> file within the 
<tt>File</tt> section, while the stress tensor is loaded by specifying the 
<tt>Piezo</tt> file within the <tt>File</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
File {
  Grid = device.tdr
  Piezo = device.tdr
}
</pre>

<p>If the <tt>Piezo</tt> file is not specified, no stress is loaded. 
As shown in this example, the <tt>Grid</tt> file and the <tt>Piezo</tt> file 
are often the same.</p>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>4.2 Coordinate System for Stress</h1>

<p>The stress tensor is a 3x3 symmetric tensor and is defined by default 
within the simulation coordinate system. In a typical TCAD flow, the stress 
tensor is computed during the process simulation for a device with 
a particular orientation with respect to the crystallographic coordinate system. 
In Sentaurus  Device, this simulation coordinate system must be specified using 
the <tt>LatticeParameters</tt> section of the parameter file. Typically, this 
section specifies the directions of the x- and y-axes of the simulation 
coordinate system relative to the crystallographic axes. Then, the direction of the 
z-axis is computed automatically. Some common examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>FinFET with a (110) sidewall and &lt;110&gt; channel in which the x-axis is 
  along the channel direction, the y-axis is perpendicular to the sidewalls, and 
  the z-axis is along the height of the fin:<br />
<pre>
LatticeParameters {
  X = ( 1,1,0)   #[1]
  Y = (-1,1,0)   #[1]
}
</pre></li>

<li>FinFET with a (100) sidewall and &lt;100&gt; channel in which the x-axis is 
  along the channel direction, the y-axis is perpendicular to the sidewalls, and 
  the z-axis is along the height of the fin:<br />
<pre>
LatticeParameters {
  X = (1,0,0)   #[1]
  Y = (0,1,0)   #[1]
}
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h1>4.3 Impact of Stress on Band Structure</h1>

<p>Stress modifies the band structure of silicon by splitting the edges of the 
valleys and bands that make up the conduction and valence bands. Stress also can 
modify the shape, or dispersion, of the bands resulting in a change in the 
density-of-states (DOS). Together, these effects modify the threshold voltage in a MOSFET.</p>

<p>Options are available for considering the impact of stress on band structure. The 
most physical of these options treats the impact of stress on both the band edges 
and the dispersion, and is selected using the following syntax in the <tt>Physics</tt> 
section:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  Piezo (
    Model (
      DeformationPotential(ekp hkp minimum)
      DOS(eMass hMass)
    )
  )
}
</pre>

<p>This set of models computes the level shifts to the conduction valleys and valence 
bands using the k&middot;p models, taking the bottom-most conduction valley and the 
topmost valence band to define the band gap. The stress dependency of the 
DOS mass is considered as well.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="4"></a>
<h1>4.4 Impact of Stress on Quantization Models</h1>

<p>Quantization models, such as density gradient, consider the impact of stress 
primarily through changes in the band edges as specified by the 
<tt>DeformationPotential</tt> model. Some models have options for considering 
additional impacts of stress on quantization. Specifically for the density gradient 
model, there is an option to use the strained DOS mass in the 
density-gradient equation. However, it is recommended to use the default setting 
for this option in which only the relaxed DOS mass is used. Comparisons 
to detailed solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation show this setting produces 
better agreement for the threshold voltage.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="5"></a>
<h1>4.5 Stress-Dependent Mobility Models</h1>

<p>The mobility gain due to stress in a MOSFET channel depends strongly on 
the surface and channel orientations. In a FinFET device with multiple surface 
orientations for the top and sidewalls, it is convenient to use models that treat 
this orientation dependency automatically. This section provides comments and 
recommendations for these types of mobility model.</p>

<!--=======================-->
<a name="51"></a>
<h2>4.5.1 Subband Stress-Mobility Models for Electrons and Holes</h2>

<p>The subband stress-mobility models work as corrections to the relaxed 
low-field mobility, including automatically accounting for different surface 
orientations. In particular, if in a FinFET, the Lombardi or IAL mobility model 
is selected to compute the relaxed low-field mobility with the 
<tt>AutoOrientation</tt> option, the subband stress-mobility models will, by 
default, automatically compute the stress-induced mobility gain for the different 
surface orientations in the fin.</p>

<p>For some surface orientations, most notably (110), the relaxed mobility is 
anisotropic and depends on the channel direction. It is necessary, therefore, 
to indicate to the subband models which channel direction to use. To select the 
required channel direction, specify either <tt>RelChDir110</tt> for a &lt;110&gt; 
channel, or <tt>-RelChDir110</tt> for a &lt;100&gt; channel, in 
the <tt>(e|h)Subband</tt> option list. <tt>RelChDir110</tt> is selected by default.</p>

<p>To enable the subband stress-mobility models to work correctly for a MOSFET channel 
(not only for the bulk), the statement <tt>MultiValley(MLDA kpDOS)</tt> must be specified 
in the <tt>Physics</tt> section. This specification also activates the 
multivalley MLDA quantization model. If you want to use density gradient as the 
quantization model, the keyword <tt>-Density</tt> also must be specified to limit 
the use of the multivalley MLDA model to only the calculation of mobility.</p>

<p>Below are recommended models and options (which are verified and calibrated for 
multiple orientations and stress cases) to specify in the <tt>Physics</tt> section 
to activate the electron and hole subband stress-mobility models with density gradient 
as the quantization model and for a &lt;110&gt; channel direction:</p>

<pre>
Physics {
  MultiValley(MLDA kpDOS -Density)
  Piezo (
    Model (
      Mobility (
        eSubband(Fermi EffectiveMass Scattering)
        hSubband(Doping EffectiveMass Scattering(MLDA))
      )
    )
  )
}
</pre>

<p class="note">The calculation of the <tt>hSubband</tt> model can be time 
consuming because it treats the strained valence band structure in great detail 
for each mesh vertex. To speed up the model, it is recommended to use the 
<tt>Doping</tt> option (compared to <tt>eSubband</tt>), which still gives good accuracy.</p>

<p>In addition, the <tt>hSubband</tt> model can require a long initial 
precomputation step before the start of any bias ramp. In this precomputation step, 
all the needed energy-dependent band- and mobility-related data is computed for 
each mesh vertex. Fortunately, this precomputation step lends itself well to 
parallelization and can be accelerated using a large number of threads.</p>

<p>The cost of this precalculation step can be spread over multiple 
runs of Sentaurus Device on the same device structure using the <tt>MVMLDAcontrols</tt> 
save/load feature. In this approach, the precomputation step is performed in a separate Sentaurus 
Device run with a large number of threads by doing only one Poisson solution and then 
saving the computed band-related data to a file using:</p>

<pre>
Math { MVMLDAcontrols(save= &quot;file_name&quot;) }
</pre>

<p>In subsequent Sentaurus Device runs, the initial <tt>hSubband</tt> precomputation 
step can be avoided by loading this file using:</p>

<pre>
Math { MVMLDAcontrols(load= &quot;file_name&quot;) }
</pre>

<h2>4.5.2 Piezoresistance Model for Electrons and Holes</h2>

<p>The piezoresistance model is a straightforward model in which the mobility 
gain is computed as either a linear or quadratic function of the stress, depending 
on whether the first-order or second-order option is selected. The appropriate 
piezoresistance coefficients are specified in the crystallographic coordinate system 
and are transformed by the tool to the simulation coordinate system.</p>

<p>When this model is applied to a FinFET channel, the surface orientation dependency of the 
stress-induced mobility gain and, therefore, the piezoresistance coefficients, should 
be considered. These coefficients can be specified for different surface orientations 
and used in conjunction with the <tt>AutoOrientation</tt> framework. When using the 
piezoresistance model in a FinFET channel, you must consider the following as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlike in a highly doped source/drain region in which the stress-induced mobility 
gain is suppressed due to high doping, the mobility gain (or reduction) in a MOSFET 
channel can become relatively large. At large stress, this gain typically saturates at 
a value that depends on the carrier type and surface/channel orientation. To 
accurately model this behavior, the <tt>MinStressFactor</tt> and <tt>MaxStressFactor</tt> 
parameters in the <tt>Piezoresistance</tt> section of the parameter file must be used.</li>

<li>The piezoresistance model is based on a bulk model, which for silicon means the 
resulting mobility reflects the cubic symmetry of relaxed silicon, that is, some 
surface/channel orientations in a MOSFET cannot be completely characterized 
by this model. In particular, for a (100)/&lt;100&gt; channel, you cannot model the 
mobility gain due to both transverse stress and vertical stress with this model.</li>
</ul>

<!--=======================-->
<a name="53"></a>
<h2>4.5.3 MCmob Model for Electrons and Holes</h2>

<p>MCmob is a nonlinear piezoresistance model that considers the impact of the 
main types of uniaxial stress on mobility: longitudinal, transverse, 
and vertical stress. This model is calibrated against reference data generated either 
by Sentaurus Device Monte Carlo or by the mobility calculation feature of Sentaurus 
Band Structure for a select set of surface/channel orientations. This model is compatible 
with the <tt>AutoOrientation</tt> framework.</p>

<p>For details and recommendations for the MCmob model, refer to the 
<cite>Advanced Calibration for Device Simulation User Guide</cite>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>4.6 Impact of Stress on Saturation Velocity</h1>

<p>In general, stress can impact both low-field and high-field mobility. 
The impact of stress on high-field mobility is primarily through the effective 
saturation velocity. Detailed device Monte Carlo studies of bulk silicon have shown 
that the stress dependency of the saturation velocity is rather weak. Therefore, 
for long-channel devices, it is recommended to suppress any change in saturation velocity due 
to stress. This can be achieved by setting the <tt>SaturationFactor</tt> parameters in 
the <tt>Piezo</tt> statement of the <tt>Physics</tt> section to 0.0 (by default, they are 
set to 1.0):</p>

<pre>
Piezo (
  Model (
    Mobility (
      eSaturationFactor=0.0
      hSaturationFactor=0.0
    )
  )
)
</pre>

<p>For short-channel devices, quasiballistic transport is expected to play a larger role 
in device behavior. Device Monte Carlo studies have shown that quasiballistic transport 
is affected by stress. While drift-diffusion simulations cannot physically model 
quasiballistic transport, the effect of quasiballistic transport on device behavior can 
be approximated by changing the saturation velocity.</p>

<p>The effect of stress on quasiballistic transport can, therefore, be modeled as a stress 
dependency of the saturation velocity. For strained short-channel devices, the 
<tt>SaturationFactor</tt> parameter then becomes a fitting parameter, and a value larger than 0 
might be more appropriate. Alternatively, the saturation velocity itself can be tuned to account 
for the combined impact of gate length and stress on quasiballistic transport.</p>

<h1>4.7 Discretization Options for Tensor Mobility Models</h1>

<p>Some of the stress-dependent mobility models produce a tensor mobility. There are 
several options for selecting how such models should be treated numerically and, 
in particular, how they are discretized onto the device mesh. For 3D devices, it is 
recommended to use the <tt>TensorFactor</tt> option in the <tt>Math</tt> section to 
improve stability and speed. This can be activated using:</p>

<pre>
Math { StressMobilityDependence=TensorFactor }
</pre>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="8"></a>
<h1>4.8 Plotting Stress-Dependent Mobility and Factors</h1>

<p>With <tt>StressMobilityDependence=TensorFactor</tt> specified in the 
<tt>Math</tt> section, several field quantities related to stress-dependent 
mobility can be saved in the plot file as follows.</p>

<table width="570">
<tr>
<th>Plot name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>(e|h)MobilityStressFactorXX</tt> and so on</td>
<td>Low-field mobility gain due to stress.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>(e|h)TensorMobilityFactorXX</tt> and so on</td>
<td>High-field mobility gain due to stress.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>(e|h)TensorMobilityXX</tt> and so on</td>
<td>High-field mobility due to stress.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note">When <tt>StressMobilityDependence=TensorFactor</tt> is specified 
in the <tt>Math</tt> section, only the diagonal components of these field 
quantities are relevant.</p>
