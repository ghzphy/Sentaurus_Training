<h1>3.1 Advanced Calibration for Mechanics Simulations</h1>

<p>It is recommended to switch on <tt>AdvancedCalibration</tt> for mechanics simulations. 
The Advanced Calibration file (in section&nbsp;2.15) includes a set of recommended 
mechanical parameters for the materials of the most common electronics as well as 
appropriate settings for mechanics simulations. These parameters are loaded automatically 
(see <a href="../sp/sp_6.html">Section&nbsp;6. Working With Advanced Calibration</a>).</p>

<p>For more information, see the <cite>Advanced Calibration for Process Simulation 
User Guide</cite>.</p>

<h1>3.2 Modeling Stress Induced by CESL and Epitaxial SiGe Layers in Sentaurus Process</h1>

<p>To model the impact of built-in stress in a material upon its deposition, 
the normal stresses along all three axes with identical components must be 
specified. When the stress-rebalancing calculation is performed, the initial 
isotropic normal stress will change according to the particular geometry. 
For example, isotropic built-in stress in a very thin film will vanish in the 
normal direction to the surface; whereas, the lateral stress components will 
change and remain nonzero.</p>

<p>For accurate calculation of the stress introduced by <em>amorphous stress sources</em> 
such as a strained nitride contact etch stop layer (CESL), deposition must be split 
into several substeps. After each substep, stress rebalancing must be performed. 
When the number of substeps is large enough, the calculated stress values saturate 
to their correct levels. Practically, the number of substeps is in the range 
from 5 to 10, limited by the CPU time and  the mesh size. One of the first descriptions 
of this approach was by Loiko <em>et al.</em> <a href="#loiko-2006">[Ref. 1]</a>. 
See <a href="#6">Section&nbsp;3.6 Intrinsic Stress</a> for the syntax using 
&quot;fields&quot; to introduce intrinsic stress at deposition steps.</p>

<p>From a physics perspective, this is caused by the interatomic bonds in amorphous 
material adjusting under the changing stress and geometry during deposition. 
This happens almost instantly, in a matter of picoseconds. Such adjustments of the 
interatomic bonds translate into local stress and should be updated after absorption 
of each atom for  ultimate accuracy. However, for practical purposes, it is sufficient 
to do the updates in several substeps per deposition.</p>

<p>The requirement for the film thickness deposited per each substep is such that 
it is much less than the feature sizes of the surface on which it is being deposited. 
Considering that deposition typically makes the surfaces increasingly smooth during 
the deposition, it might be reasonable to start with smaller substeps and continue 
with increasing substeps until the entire film thickness is deposited.</p>

<p>For accurate calculation of the stress introduced by <em>epitaxial films with 
lattice mismatch</em>, a different approach is necessary. Specifically, 
<em>stress rebalancing should be done only after depositing the entire film</em>. 
To calculate the lattice mismatch stress, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the lattice mismatch feature (see <a href="#4">Section 3.4 Lattice Mismatch Stress</a>); 
default is on for SiGe.</li>
<li>Use isotropic intrinsic stress (see <a href="#6">Section 3.6 Intrinsic Stress</a>).</li>
</ul> 

<p>For SiGe, you must switch off the lattice mismatch feature if you choose to use 
the intrinsic stress approach to avoid double-counting the effect by specifying:</p>

<pre>
pdbUnSetDoubleArray Silicon Germanium Conc.Strain
</pre>

<p>If multiple deposition steps are needed, you must switch off stress 
balance between these deposition steps. That is, add the following commands before 
the first SiGe deposition step:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Mechanics EtchDepoRelax 0
pdbSet Mechanics StressHistory 0
</pre>

<p>After all SiGe deposition steps are completed, switch on the above two
parameters by setting them to 1, and do a short diffusion to rebalance the stress.</p>

<p>From a physics perspective, this is caused by the entire epitaxial film having the 
same perfect crystal lattice as the substrate on which it is grown. Therefore, during the 
epitaxy, there are no irreversible adjustments of the interatomic bonds, which means 
that the final stress distribution is determined by the final shape of the epitaxial 
film (unless the stress is so high that dislocations are formed).</p>

<h1>3.3 Specifying NoBulkRelax for Accurate Viscoelastic Stress Analysis in Sentaurus Process</h1>

<p>Viscoelastic materials such as amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> exhibit viscous 
behavior by relaxing the deviatoric stress components. For accurate modeling of 
stress evolution in such materials, specify <tt>NoBulkRelax</tt>:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet mechanics NoBulkRelax 1
</pre>

<p>For example, stress in a narrow shallow trench isolation filled with 
a spin-on-glass oxide or flowable chemical vapor deposition(CVD) oxide 
can be quite different if <tt>NoBulkRelax</tt> is not switched on.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>WARNING</strong> This parameter affects the oxidation shape, 
thickness, and stress inside the oxide. You must do a calibration accordingly. For 
LOCOS structures, this parameter changes the shape, especially when stress-dependent 
oxidation is switched on.</p>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>3.4 Lattice Mismatch Stress</h1>

<p>To simulate lattice mismatch stress, two flags control the automatic updating of 
strain and lattice spacing:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Silicon Mechanics UpdateStrain 1
pdbSet Mechanics LatticeHistory 1
</pre>

<p>These flags are switched on by default and should remain switched on for the 
calculation of the lattice mismatch stress.</p>

<p>To activate lattice mismatch stress, you also need to define the strain profile 
by specifying:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetDoubleArray Silicon &lt;dopant_name&gt; Conc.Strain {0 0 1 &lt;n&gt;}
</pre>

<p>Only the germanium strain profile is defined by default internally by:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetDoubleArray Silicon Germanium Conc.Strain {0 0 1 0.0425}
</pre>

<p>For other species such as carbon, you must set them yourself. The strain profile 
can be calculated approximately, based on the lattice constants of the materials. 
For example, the germanium strain profile can be calculated by:</p>

<p>(<em>L</em><sub>Ge</sub> &ndash; <em>L</em><sub>Si</sub>)/<em>L</em><sub>Si</sub> = (5.66 &ndash; 5.43)/5.43 = 0.042</p>

<p>The reference relaxed position is set to the bottom of the Si substrate by default. 
This works for the SiGe source/drain on a Si substrate. However, there are cases where 
you need to redefine the reference position such as for multiple-graded SiGe-strained layers. 
In those cases, you can set the top relaxed node coordinate accordingly by:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetDouble Silicon Mechanics TopRelaxedNodeCoord &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

<h1>3.5 Thermal Mismatch Stress</h1>

<p>By default internally, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of the materials 
are recalculated relative to silicon when simulating thermal mismatch stress. 
This is due to the assumption that the substrate is very large compared to devices, 
so thermal expansion is dominated by the thick silicon substrate, and no thermal 
expansion stress or wafer bending occurs in the thick substrate.</p>

<p>For substrate materials other than silicon, you must tag it with the keyword 
<tt>substrate</tt> in the <tt>region</tt> command, so that the CTEs are calculated 
relative to the tagged substrate material instead. To overwrite the reference CTE 
by a user-specified value, use:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetDouble Mechanics RefThExpCoeff &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

<p>Relaxation of thermal mismatch stress is calculated when a temperature ramp is 
defined at diffusion by default in two dimensions. However, in three dimensions, the 
keyword <tt>stress.relax</tt> must be set in the <tt>diffuse</tt> command explicitly.</p>

<p>When automatic tracing of stress history is needed, ensure that you set:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Mechanics StressHistory 1
pdbSet Mechanics EtchDepoRelax 1
</pre>

<p>With stress history switched off, the thermal mismatch stress is calculated 
only when a <tt>temp_ramp</tt> is defined in the <tt>diffuse</tt> command. In that 
case, remember to define the complete temperature ramp cycle. Otherwise, excess thermal 
mismatch stress might remain. For example, when a ramp-up from 25&deg;C to 1000&deg;C is 
simulated, at the following steps, there should be a ramp-down step to cycle the temperature 
back to 25&deg;C. However, if stress history is switched on, Sentaurus Process will handle 
this automatically.</p>

<p>In 3D simulations, to speed up the simulation, you usually do not switch on stress 
history unless accurate stress history information is required.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>3.6 Intrinsic Stress</h1>

<p>Typically, intrinsic stress is applied using the <tt>stressdata</tt> command, 
which sets intrinsic stress for existing materials or regions, such as:</p>

<pre>
stressdata nitride sxxi=1e10 syyi=1e10 szzi=1e10   <em>(unit is dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>)</em>
</pre>

<p>Usually, a <tt>diffuse</tt> command follows a <tt>stressdata</tt> command, 
so that the intrinsic stress can rebalance due to the geometry. However, when 
using multiple steps for one deposition to rebalance stress after each sub-deposition 
step, the <tt>stressdata</tt> command is not a good choice. For this condition, in the 
<tt>deposit</tt> command, you can define stress in <tt>fields</tt> (unit is Pa), 
for example:</p>

<pre>
deposit nitride thickness=0.2&lt;um&gt; \
  fields= {StressELXX StressELYY StressELZZ} \
  values= {1e9 1e9 1e9} steps=5
</pre>

<p>Then, when stress is rebalanced after each substep, the intrinsic stress is 
applied accordingly.</p>
