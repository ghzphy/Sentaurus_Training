<h1>2.3 How can I improve convergence in simulations of wide-bandgap-based devices?</h1>

<p>Simulations involving wide-bandgap materials are more prone to convergence 
problems due to the numeric challenges in performing floating-point operations with 
extremely large and extremely small numbers such as the concentrations of majority 
and minority carriers in wide-bandgap semiconductors.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<h2>2.3.1 Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you experience convergence problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the physics of the device.<br />
Convergence problems are frequently caused by improper meshing of the structure. 
A good mesh needs to capture the physics well. For example, depletion regions and 
impact ionization generation must be captured well to prevent convergence issues.</li>

<li>Tighten up numeric settings.<br />
For SiC numeric settings, see 
<a href="../sd/sd_15.html#4">Section&nbsp;15.4 SiC-Specific Numeric Parameters</a>.<br />
For III&ndash;nitride numeric settings, see 
<a href="../sd/sd_16.html#6">Section&nbsp;16.6 AlGaN-Specific Numeric Parameters</a>.</li>

<li>To improve convergence in low-density or low-current regions, see 
<a href="../sd/sd_6.html#6">Section&nbsp;6.6 Improving Convergence in Low-Density or Low-Current Regions</a>.</li>

<li>Start the debugging process by switching off all physical models. Then, switch 
them on again one-by-one to find out which model causes problems.</li>

<li>See if boundary conditions (BCs) are contradictory.<br />
For example, an electrode touching a semiconductor and an insulator at a corner 
will apply an Ohmic BC (default) to nodes touching the semiconductor, and a gate-like 
BC to nodes touching the insulator. These different BCs will lead 
to abrupt variations in potential around the corner that can lead to convergence 
issues, especially if the <tt>Avalanche</tt> model is switched on. The simplest 
solution to this problem is to use a workfunction specification for an electrode,
which leads to a flat band condition around the corner.</li>

<li>Often, using more realistic physics and solution methods can lead to better 
convergence (see 
<a href="#realphysics">Section&nbsp;2.3.2 Realistic Physics and Solution Methods</a>).</li>

<li>Use Sentaurus Device tools to find out which equation is responsible for problems 
and where it is in the device (see 
<a href="#debugtools">Section&nbsp;2.3.3 Tools for Debugging Convergence Problems</a>).</li>
</ol>

<h2>2.3.2 Realistic Physics and Solution Methods</h2>

<p>Often, removing some numeric idealities can improve convergence, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running in transient instead of steady state is often beneficial in terms of robust 
convergence behavior. It also helps if there are some natively &quot;dynamic&quot; objects 
(such as traps) involved in the simulation. Using transient is as easy as using steady state. 
Simply replace <tt>Quasistationary</tt> with <tt>Transient</tt> and, if present, remove 
the pulse specification from the <tt>Electrode</tt> section. By default, the ramp time is 
1&nbsp;s, but you can add it explicitly in the <tt>Transient</tt> specification by using 
the <tt>FinalTime</tt> specification:<br />

<pre>
Electrode {
  ...
  { Name=&quot;drain&quot; Voltage= 0.0 Resistor= 1e10 } 
}
Math { Transient= BE }
Solve {
  ...
  Transient ( 
    InitialStep= 1e-4 Increment= 1.4 [InitialTime=... FinalTime=...]
    Goal { Name="drain" Voltage=5000 }
  ) { Coupled {Poisson Electron Hole} } 
}
</pre></li>

<li>Sometimes, switching on a small amount of optical generation helps to raise 
the concentration of minority carriers. Generation rate values as low as 
10<sup>6</sup> pairs/s-cm<sup>-3</sup>, which translate into a few carriers 
generated in years in micrometer-scale devices, are sufficient to make 
simulations of wide-bandgap semiconductors more robust:<br />

<pre>
Physics {
  ...
  Optics(OpticalGeneration(SetConstant(Value=1e6)))
}
</pre></li>

<li>Ideal insulators can lead to the accumulation of minute quantities of carriers 
that are essentially isolated pools of carriers. For example, minority carriers will 
accumulate at insulator&ndash;semiconductor interfaces of MOSFETs and MISHFETs, or 
at internal barriers in heterostructure devices and lead to convergence problems with 
continuity equations.<br />
Any numeric &quot;tap&quot; into these isolated pools of carriers leads to 
improved convergence. Switching on tunneling so that carriers connect to the next 
layer or to the &quot;outside world&quot; is a method used to improve convergence 
in these cases. Here is an example of how to switch on hole tunneling across an 
alumina barrier in a MISHFET:<br />

<pre>
Physics {
  ...
  hBarrierTunneling &quot;NLM&quot;
}

Math {
  ...
  Nonlocal &quot;NLM&quot; (Barrier(Region=&quot;Al2O3_Ins&quot;))
}
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>2.3.3 Tools for Debugging Convergence Problems</h2>

<p>Sentaurus Device provides the keywords <tt>CNormPrint</tt> and <tt>NewtonPlot</tt>, 
which constitute powerful tools to understand and resolve convergence issues.</p>

<p><tt>CNormPrint</tt> prints, after each Newton iteration, one line for each equation 
being solved, with the name of the equation, the maximum update error, its corresponding 
coordinate, and the value of the solution variable at that location. Inspection of the 
output or log files typically indicates which equation is responsible for 
convergence problems and the location where errors are largest.</p>

<p><tt>NewtonPlot</tt> plots TDR files with maps of errors and residuals for each equation, 
which is essentially the same information as <tt>CNormPrint</tt>, but in a more 
comprehensive and graphical way.</p>

<p>In both cases, the information is most useful after the Newton iteration that brought 
the solution closest to convergence, with often only one equation still struggling. 
In addition, you are typically interested in <em>Newton plots</em> only when the simulation 
is on the verge of failing to converge, that is, when the bias step is close to its minimum 
allowed by the <tt>MinStep</tt> keyword.</p>

<p>The following <tt>Math</tt> section excerpt demonstrates how to switch on these 
convergence-monitoring tools in such a way that Newton plots are created only for small 
bias steps and for the iteration that was closest to convergence:</p>

<pre>
Math {
  ...
  CNormPrint
  NewtonPlot (Error MinError Residual)
}
</pre>

<p>The generated <tt>NewtonPlot</tt> TDR files in this example are named 
<tt>n@node@_np_&lt;iteration number&gt;_min_des.tdr</tt>. The choice of file name 
is specified in the <tt>File</tt> section:</p>

<pre>
File {
  ...
  NewtonPlot= &quot;n@node@_np_%d_%d_des.tdr&quot;
}
</pre>

<p>The first C-format specifier (<tt>%d</tt>) is replaced by the bias step number 
and the second C-format specifier is replaced by <tt>min</tt> since you chose to 
plot only a file for the Newton iteration that is closest to convergence.</p>

<p>See <a href="../sd/sd_6.html">Section&nbsp;6. Nonlinear System Newton Solver</a> 
for further help on how to improve convergence.</p>

<h1>2.4 My simulation runs slowly. How can I speed it up?</h1>

<p>Devices based on wide-bandgap materials are usually used in power applications 
and are often large. As a consequence, mesh sizes also tend to be large and 
simulations take longer than simulations of devices for other applications.</p>

<p>The default linear solver SUPER is the most accurate and leads to the most 
robust simulations. Therefore, SUPER is typically the linear solver of choice when 
simulating wide-bandgap-based devices. However, significant progress has been made 
with the iterative solver ILS, which is significantly faster than SUPER. 
In addition, while SUPER can be used only for single-thread (single CPU core) 
simulations, ILS can be parallelized and can take advantage of modern multicore machines.</p>

<p>The ILS solver with default numeric parameters leads to simulations that are typically not robust 
enough. However, by tightening up some of its numeric parameters, you can run robust 
simulations of SiC- and GaN-based devices significantly faster than with the SUPER solver.</p>

<p>Typical <tt>Math</tt> sections are listed in 
<a href="../sd/sd_15.html#4">Section&nbsp;15.4 SiC-Specific Numeric Parameters</a> and 
<a href="../sd/sd_16.html#6">Section&nbsp;16.6 AlGaN-Specific Numeric Parameters</a>. 
However, depending on the specific application, other more relaxed settings might work faster.</p>

<p>To benefit from the multicore capability of the ILS solver, the number of parallel threads 
is set with <tt>NumberOfThreads</tt>:</p>

<pre>
Math {
  ...
  NumberOfThreads=4    * Simulation uses 4 threads (requires parallel license)
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>See <a href="../sd/sd_9.html#4">Section 9.4 Linear Solvers</a> for details 
about ILS numeric parameters.</p>
