<h2 class="obj">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
 <li>To present some practical approaches for back-end-of-line (BEOL) stress simulation.</li> 
</ul>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1"></a>
<h1>5.1 Effective Material Approach</h1>

<p>When analyzing stress for a large structure, for example, the thermal mismatch 
stress between the silicon chip and package substrate, it is not practical to consider 
fine features such as metal wires in the BEOL layers. However, the contribution of 
the stressed BEOL stack to the stress equilibrium of the chip-package structure 
cannot be simply ignored.</p>

<p>One approach to effectively consider the BEOL contribution is to use the concept of 
&quot;smear&quot; material. With this approach, the BEOL layers are treated as a single 
layer of &quot;smear&quot; material. The &quot;smear&quot; material properties are the 
volume average of the metal wires and dielectrics. Typically, three elastic model parameters 
must be defined: Young's modulus, Poisson ratio, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). 
For Young's modulus, the &quot;smear&quot; material parameter is calculated as:</p>

<p><em>E</em><sub>smear</sub> = <em>E</em><sub>metal</sub> x 
<tt>Volume percentage of metal</tt> + <em>E</em><sub>dielectrics</sub> x 
<tt>Volume percentage of dielectrics</tt></p>

<p>Similar expressions can be written for the Poisson ratio and CTE. These new material 
properties are introduced in the simulation flow with the following statements:</p>

<pre>
mater add name= Smear new.like= Nitride
pdbSet Smear Mechanics BulkModulus 33.0e10
pdbSet Smear Mechanics ShearModulus 28.2e10
pdbSet Smear Mechanics ThExpCoeff 15.3e-6
</pre>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="2"></a>
<h1>5.2 Converting Elastic Material Parameters</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Interconnect uses the bulk modulus and the shear modulus 
to define material elastic properties, while many times, available BEOL material 
properties are given in terms of Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio. The following 
statements convert user data in terms of Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio 
to the bulk modulus and the shear modulus required in the simulations:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Copper Mechanics BulkModulus  [Enu2K 111.5e10 0.343]
pdbSet Copper Mechanics ShearModulus [Enu2G 111.5e10 0.343]
</pre>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="3"></a>
<h1>5.3 Avoiding Zero Plastic Hardening Modulus</h1>

<p>When modeling plasticity with bilinear hardening laws, the onset of plastic 
deformation is controlled by the material yield stress, and the material hardening 
is measured by the hardening modulus. For numeric reasons, it is recommended to 
avoid using the zero plastic hardening modulus.</p>

<p>Even for rigid plastic materials, a small nonzero value of the hardening modulus 
can often improve numeric convergence. The following statements can adjust 
the hardening modulus:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetDouble &lt;material&gt; Mechanics Hardening.Modulus.Isotropic &lt;n&gt;
pdbSetDouble &lt;material&gt; Mechanics Hardening.Modulus.Kinematic &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

<p>The parameter <tt>Hardening.Modulus.Isotropic</tt> corresponds to the isotropic 
hardening modulus, and the parameter <tt>Hardening.Modulus.Kinematic</tt> corresponds 
to the kinematic hardening modulus.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="4"></a>
<h1>5.4 Taking Advantage of Symmetry</h1>

<p>Symmetry is commonly observed in BEOL structures. Using symmetric boundary 
conditions can substantially reduce the computational task. For example, stress 
analysis for a through-silicon via (TSV) array can be performed using a quarter 
of a TSV with symmetric boundary conditions applied. The mechanical symmetric boundary
conditions can be specified as:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Mechanics Left  BoundaryCondition Dirichlet
pdbSet Mechanics Right BoundaryCondition Dirichlet
pdbSet Mechanics Front BoundaryCondition Dirichlet
pdbSet Mechanics Back  BoundaryCondition Dirichlet
</pre>

<p>Similarly, the symmetric boundary conditions can be applied with <tt>stressdata</tt> 
commands:</p>

<pre>
stressdata bc.location=Left  bc.value= { dy=0.0 }
stressdata bc.location=Right bc.value= { dy=0.0 }
stressdata bc.location=Front bc.value= { dz=0.0 }
stressdata bc.location=Back  bc.value= { dz=0.0 }
</pre>

<p>After the simulation, the structure with solution fields can be reflected 
multiple times to generate a large structure for visualization purposes.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="5"></a>
<h1>5.5 Mechanical Coupling Boundary Conditions</h1>

<p>When simulating material thermal mismatch of a unit cell inside a large 
structure with finite layer thicknesses, the deformation of all layers often 
needs to be modeled explicitly. To approximate the constraints from surrounding 
materials, mechanical coupling boundary conditions on the unit cell can be applied as:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Mechanics &lt;Left | Right | Back | Front&gt; &lt;Cx | Cy | Cz&gt; 1
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>Cx</tt>, <tt>Cy</tt>, or <tt>Cz</tt> stands for the coupling of the displacement 
component in the x-, y-, or z-direction.</p>

<p class="note">All other boundary conditions defined with the <tt>pdbSet</tt> 
method become invalid with the application of the coupling boundary condition. 
These boundary conditions must be redefined using the <tt>stressdata</tt> command.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>5.6 Structure Generation for Cylinders and Spheres in BEOL</h1>

<p>Cylinder and sphere objects are common in BEOL structures, for example, interconnect 
vias, TSVs, microbumps, and solder bumps. These objects cannot easily be generated by 
deposition and etching with standard masks.</p>

<p>There are several practical approaches to generate these objects. One approach is 
to generate these objects in Sentaurus Structure Editor and then insert them in the 
simulation. The following example shows the statements to generate a solder ball:</p>

<pre>
sde external { (sdegeo:create-sphere (position $x $y $z) 
  $radius &quot;material&quot; &quot;region&quot;) }
polyhedron name= sphere1 external.sde
sde off
insert polyhedron= sphere1 replace.materials= { replace_material }
</pre>

<p>Another approach for generating cylinders is to create circular masks either in 
Silicon WorkBench or in simulation input, and then perform etching 
and deposition with circular marks. When applying this approach, you must be aware that 
the number of points defined around a circle will affect the final mesh. Usually, 
36 points provide good enough resolution. Too many points can lead to an unnecessarily 
dense mesh. You also can use the shape library for some shapes, for example, 
<tt>PolygonWaferMask</tt>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="7"></a>
<h1>5.7 Structure Generation for Unconventional BEOL Process Steps</h1>

<p>BEOL structure generation can involve unconventional process steps such as 
die stacking, bumping, and underfilling. These process steps result in structures 
that cannot be generated by conventional deposition and etching operations. Sometimes, 
the structure must be flipped and the location must be translated.</p>

<p>A practical approach for generating such structures is to build 
structure components individually and then to assemble them. This assembly process 
can be achieved using statements such as <tt>polyhedron tdr=...</tt> to insert one 
structure component into the target structure, <tt>transform flip</tt> to flip a 
component before assembly, and <tt>transform translate ...</tt> to align components 
in the required locations.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="8"></a>
<h1>5.8 Defining Contact and Crack Locations in the Unified Coordinate System</h1>

<p>BEOL stress simulation and failure analysis often require the definition of contact 
and crack locations. Although the unified coordinate system (UCS) is recommended, the 
DF&ndash;ISE coordinate system also is supported for structure generation in Sentaurus Structure 
Editor. The coexistence of the UCS and the DF&ndash;ISE coordinate system can lead to confusion 
when defining contact and crack locations.</p>

<p>Be aware that all geometry location definitions must be specified in 
UCS coordinates. For example:</p>

<pre>
contact box xlo=-0.01 ylo=-0.46 xhi=0.1 yhi=-0.16 name=source Aluminum
crack name=Si_Ox mat.1=Silicon mat.2=Oxide CZM=none tolerance=1.0e-6 \ 
  x.min=-0.1 x.max=-0.05 y.min=-0.1 y.max=-0.05 z.min=0.0 z.max=0.4 \
  normal= { 0.0 0.0 1.0 } angle.tolerance=1.0e-3
</pre>

<p>The specified coordinates are all in UCS. You must manually convert the coordinates 
if the original structures are in DF&ndash;ISE coordinates.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="9"></a>
<h1>5.9 Linearizing Dielectric Materials at BEOL Process Temperatures</h1>

<p>Dielectric materials often exhibit viscoelastic behavior at elevated temperatures 
but elastic behavior at BEOL process temperatures. By default, TCAD tools use 
viscoelastic models for dielectric materials. This default setting often leads to 
unnecessary computation during BEOL stress simulations. It is recommended to 
linearize dielectric-material mechanical properties at BEOL temperatures with the 
following statements:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet &lt;material&gt; Mechanics Vcrit0 1e-30
pdbSet &lt;material&gt; Mechanics VcritW 0.0
pdbSet &lt;material&gt; Mechanics Viscosity0 1e40
pdbSet &lt;material&gt; Mechanics ViscosityW 0.0
</pre>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="10"></a>
<h1>5.10 Time-Step Control for BEOL Stress Simulation With Only Linear Models</h1>

<p>For elastic materials in BEOL structures, the constitutive relations are linear. 
When performing a thermal ramp from the initial temperature to the final temperature, 
the <tt>solve</tt> command must be constructed in such a way that only one solve step 
is performed. For example:</p>

<pre>
solve temperature=170.0&lt;C&gt; t.final=25.0&lt;C&gt; delNT= 145.0 \
  time=0.1&lt;s&gt; init= 0.1&lt;s&gt; maxstep= 0.1&lt;s&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, the total time, the initial time step, and the maximum time step 
are all set to 0.1&nbsp;s. The maximum temperature step during the temperature ramp-down 
from 170&deg;C to 25&deg;C is defined as 145&deg;C. To avoid large ramp rate&ndash;induced 
numeric issues, the time step should not be too small.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="11"></a>
<h1>5.11 Time-Step Control for BEOL Stress Simulation With Nonlinear Models</h1>

<p>For some materials in BEOL structures such as copper, plastic deformation can 
occur when the material stress level exceeds the yield strength. For some other 
materials, creep and viscoplastic deformation can occur. In addition, cohesive 
surface separation is a nonlinear process. The nonlinear constitutive relation 
requires small time steps to avoid numeric convergence problems.</p>

<p>It is recommended to limit both the initial time step and the maximum time step 
for each loading step. The following command sets the initial time step to 1% of the 
thermal loading and the maximum time step to 10% of the loading:</p>

<pre>
solve temperature= 170.0&lt;C&gt; t.final= 25.0&lt;C&gt; time= 0.1&lt;s&gt; \
  init= 0.001&lt;s&gt; maxstep= 0.01&lt;s&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, the initial loading is set to (170 &ndash; 25) x 0.001&deg;C, and 
the maximum time step is limited to (170 &ndash; 25) x 0.01&deg;C.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="12"></a>
<h1>5.12 Modeling Deformation With Moving Mesh</h1>

<p>When a moving mesh is used to resolve structural deformation and displacement 
under either a point force or a contact loading, it is important to ensure that 
only small deformations and small displacements occur under each loading/moving 
step.</p>

<p>For point-force loading, the following parameter must be set to update the 
point-force location during deformation:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetBoolean Mechanics Point.Force.Snap 1
</pre>

<p>For contact loading, the new contact location after mesh moving must be 
within the original contact box.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="13"></a>
<h1>5.13 Modeling Crack Opening on Top Surface</h1>

<p>When modeling a crack opening on the top surface, the top gas region must 
be removed in the simulation to allow proper crack surface separation and 
crack opening visualization. This requirement might be removed in a future release.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="14"></a>
<h1>5.14 J-Integral Calculations With Multiple Contours</h1>

<p>When calculating J-integral at the crack tip, the mesh must be refined around 
the crack tip front. The J-integral calculation should always be performed with multiple
contours. The following example selects nine contours for the calculation:</p>

<pre>
j_integral crack=edge x=2.0 y=3.0 z=1.0 number=9
</pre>

<p>The calculated J-integral values should be examined, and the stable contour value 
away from the crack tip front should be selected.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="15"></a>
<h1>5.15 General Guidelines for Submodel Technique</h1>

<p>When applying the submodel technique to obtain accurate resolution in some 
local regions of interest, several guidelines need to be observed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local model boundaries should be far away from high-stress concentration regions.</li>

<li>The global model does not need to include all local details, for example, 
fillets, chamfers, and tiny features. They complicate the structure and mesh, 
while not influencing the global analysis outcome.</li>

<li>The global mesh should be fine enough to provide a reasonable solution to be 
used as the local model boundary conditions.</li>

<li>Mechanical and thermal loadings should be duplicated in both models.</li>

<li>Results should be carefully examined to validate submodel boundary selection.</li>

<li>Absolute coefficients of thermal expansion should be used in both global and 
local models with the following setting: <tt>pdbSetDouble Mechanics RefThExpCoeff 0.0</tt></li>

<li>When using the <tt>temp_ramp</tt> command in the local model, all 
<tt>temp_ramp</tt> commands defined in the global model first must be cleared 
with the following statement in the local model: <tt>temp_ramp clear</tt></li>
</ul>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="16"></a>
<h1>5.16 Meshing Parameter Recommendations for Large Structures With Curved Surfaces</h1>

<p>The default meshing parameters, which are selected to resolve geometry details 
in small structures with flat surfaces, can lead to highly anisotropic meshes with 
thin layers of elements at material interfaces and overrefinements on curved surfaces. 
To generate isotropic-like meshes with regular equilateral elements and to prevent 
overrefinement on curved surfaces, it is recommended to use meshing parameters 
that are more suitable for stress analysis in large structures. These meshing parameters 
can be invoked by the following command:</p>

<pre>
SetMechanicsMeshMode
</pre>

<p>After this command, regular mesh-generation commands, such as <tt>grid remesh</tt>, 
are needed to start mesh-generation operations. Since geometries can be very different in real 
applications, some manual adjustments of these parameters might still be needed to achieve 
optimal mesh qualities for stress analysis. The important meshing parameters include:</p> 

<pre>
pdbSet Grid SnMesh Apply.Brep.DelPSC 1               ;# default 0
pdbSet Grid SnMesh Apply.Brep.DelPSC.Resolution 0.1  ;# default 0.01 [um] 
pdbSet Grid SnMesh Apply.Brep.DelPSC.Accuracy 0.005  ;# default 0.0001 [um]
pdbSet Grid SnMesh ImprintAccuracy 0.1               ;# default 1e-5 [um]
pdbSet Grid SnMesh SliverDistance 0.1                ;# default 1e-3 [um]
</pre>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li>To start manual adjustments, <tt>Apply.Brep.DelPSC</tt> must be switched on, 
so that the Delaunay refinement for piecewise smooth complex (DelPSC) algorithm can be applied.</li>
<li>The parameter <tt>Apply.Brep.DelPSC.Resolution</tt> controls the sampling of ridges 
and its value can change from 0.1 for TSV scale geometries to 10.0 for solder bump scale geometries.</li>
<li>The parameter <tt>Apply.Brep.DelPSC.Accuracy</tt> controls the accuracy in high 
curvature areas and its value can range between 0.005 and 0.5 for TSV and solder bump scale geometries.</li>
<li>The parameter <tt> ImprintAccuracy</tt> controls axis-aligned imprinting and its 
recommended value can be chosen between 0.1 and 2.0.</li>
<li>The parameter <tt> SliverDistance</tt> controls the removal of sliver elements and its 
recommended value can vary between 0.1 and 10.0 for TSV and solder bump scale geometries.</li>
</ul>

<!--================================================--> 
<a name="17"></a> 
<h1>5.17 Guidelines for Cohesive Zone Modeling</h1>

<p>Cohesive zone modeling requires defining (1) a cohesive zone model (CZM) 
law that governs the traction and separation behavior on cohesive surfaces, and 
(2) a cohesive  path where cohesive surfaces can separate to form a crack.</p>

<p>The following commands define a CZM law named <tt>law1</tt> and a cohesive path 
named <tt>crk01</tt>:</p>

<pre>
CZM name=law1 law=exponential \
   normal.stress.max=1.0e9 shear.stress.max=1.0e9 \
   normal.toughness=1e5 shear.toughness=1e5 mat.1=Mat1 mat.2=Mat2

crack name=crk01 CZM=law1 \
   x.min=0 y.min=0.0 x.max=40.0 y.max=3.0 z.min=0.0 z.max=3.0 \
   tolerance=1.0e-3 mat.1=Mat1 mat.2=Mat2 angle.tolerance=1.0e-4 \
   normal= &quot;0 1 0&quot; \
   CZM.box= {xmin= 5.0 xmax= 40.0 ymin= 0.0 ymax= 3.0 zmin= 0.0 zmax= 3.0} 
</pre>

<p>In the CZM law definition, the traction and separation relation is chosen to 
be an exponential function. The maximum material 
strength in the normal and shear directions are both 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>. 
The material work of separation (that is, material fracture toughness) in the 
normal and shear directions are both 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;dyn/cm. The CZM law 
applies to a cohesive path between the first material <tt>Mat1</tt> and the second 
material <tt>Mat2</tt>.</p>

<p>In the crack and cohesive path definition, the entire cracking region contains 
an initial crack and a cohesive path ahead of the initial crack. The cracking region 
is named <tt>crk01</tt> and the CZM law to be applied is <tt>law1</tt>.</p>

<p>The larger cube that encloses the initial crack and the cohesive path extends 
from the lower-front corner (0, 0, 0) to the upper-back corner 
(40&nbsp;&micro;m, 3&nbsp;&micro;m, 3&nbsp;&micro;m) with a snapping distance of 
10<sup>&ndash;3&nbsp;</sup>&micro;m.</p>

<p>The smaller cube that encloses only the cohesive path extends from the lower-front 
corner (5&nbsp;&micro;m, 0&nbsp;&micro;m, 0&nbsp;&micro;m) to the upper-back corner 
(40&nbsp;&micro;m, 3&nbsp;&micro;m, 3&nbsp;&micro;m).</p>

<p>The initial crack and the cohesive path are between the first material <tt>Mat1</tt> 
and the second material <tt>Mat2</tt> with a surface normal (0 1 0) and a tolerance of 
10<sup>&ndash;4</sup>. All of the coordinates must be defined in the unified coordinate 
system (UCS).</p>

<p>When cohesive surfaces separate along the cohesive path, the cohesive 
traction first increases, reaches the material strength, then decreases to zero
after the total separation. To capture this entire separation event, the mesh
must be relatively uniform around the cohesive path, and the local element size 
must be comparable to the ratio of the material fracture toughness divided 
by the material strength. To allow 3D region separation in the mesh and vertex 
separation at a point on the cohesive path, the following settings must be applied:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Mechanics Model CZM
pdbSet Grid No3DMerge 1
pdbSet Mechanics Merge.Vertices 0
</pre>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="18"></a>
<h1>5.18 Defining Surface Contacts to Apply Mechanical Boundary Conditions</h1>

<p>When defining surface contacts to apply mechanical boundary conditions, 
it is important to note the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The defined surface area is the precise region where mechanical boundary
 conditions are applied.</li>

<li>When a surface contact is defined using the box-type option, the surface 
region is extracted from the mesh cut where the specified box intersects the mesh.</li>

<li>Switching off the <tt>cut.mesh</tt> option can lead to inaccuracy since 
the defined surface contact region might be smaller than the specification.</li>

<li>To define surface contacts precisely, use the <tt>line</tt> command 
to insert mesh lines at specified locations.</li>

<li>The point-type contact definition, which converts the bulk surfaces of the box 
into contacts, is intended for electrical simulations. Do not use this definition 
for mechanical simulations.</li>

<li>When boundary conditions need to be defined on a point, use the point-force boundary 
condition definition or the point-displacement rate boundary condition definition to 
directly specify the point coordinates.</li>
</ul>
