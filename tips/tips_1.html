<h2 class="obj">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
 <li>To provide guidelines for selecting the most appropriate settings for 3D simulations 
     with Sentaurus Process.</li> 
</ul>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.1"></a>
<h1>1.1 Do I need special settings for 3D process simulation mode?</h1>

<p>No special settings are needed to switch to 3D process simulation mode in Sentaurus Process.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Process uses MGOALS to simulate geometry changes during process simulation. 
MGOALS is an internally developed library targeting simulation of process-oriented steps 
such as etching and deposition.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.2"></a> 
<h1>1.2 What can I do if my 3D process simulation fails?</h1>

<p>In most cases, nontrivial failures of 3D process simulations occur during 
meshing. The primary reason for these failures is the poor quality of the 
input geometry or the geometry boundary for meshing.</p>

<p>For the purpose of studying and correcting such failures, the following steps 
are recommended:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Simulate all geometries by commenting out all steps that require meshing 
  (such as diffusion, implantation, stress, saving, and splits). To obtain additional 
  information about the geometry, specify info level 1: 
  <tt>pdbSet InfoDefault 1</tt></li>

 <li>Save snapshots of the geometry in TDR boundary format: <tt>struct tdr.bnd=&lt;c&gt;</tt></li>
  
 <li>Examine the log file. Pay attention to the value of <tt>minDihedralAngle</tt>. 
  If its value is less than 1, you can expect potential problems with the subsequent 
  meshing steps.</li>

 <li>For problematic steps, examine the saved snapshots and consider making small changes 
  to the operation. For example, adding a small isotropic component to anisotropic 
  operations can often result in significantly improved geometry quality. In many cases, 
  anisotropic operations can be combined into simple multimaterial etching with the same 
  rate for all materials (a prime example of this is spacer etching).</li>

 <li>When you are satisfied with the geometry metrics, activate all steps and rerun the 
  entire simulation.</li>

 <li>For very complicated long-running flows, you also can consider checking the 
  robustness of the meshing by replacing a step that requires a mesh with 
  <tt>grid remesh</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more details about the MGOALS module, refer to the 
<cite>Sentaurus&trade; Process User Guide</cite>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.3"></a> 
<h1>1.3 What can I do with 3D MGOALS?</h1>

<p>The 3D MGOALS module supports practically all geometric operations used in TCAD. 
For the simulation of these operations, the main algorithms used are fast level set, 
full level set, and MGOALS (proprietary) geometric.</p>

<table width="570">
<caption>Table 1. Main geometric operations and algorithms used by default.</caption>

<tr>
<th>3D MGOALS operation</th>
<th>Default algorithm</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Isotropic etching and deposition</td>
<td>Fast level set</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Anisotropic (vertical) etching and deposition</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>MGOALS geometric</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Fourier etching and deposition</td>
<td>Full level set</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Anisotropic, isotropic, and directional operations can be forced to use 
the full level-set algorithm by adding the <tt>force.full.levelset</tt> option. 
In general, this should be used only in special cases such as multimaterial etching 
with different rates for the different materials, or material exposure detection.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.4"></a> 
<h1>1.4 Which resolution should I use with 3D MGOALS?</h1>

<p>In general, the default setting is recommended for most geometry simulations with 
MGOALS.</p>

<p>In some cases though, it might be beneficial to adjust the default resolution. 
One example is when working with a large structure. To reduce CPU time and memory usage 
and, at the same time, to decrease the complexity of the structure (and thereby the load 
on Sentaurus Mesh), you might want to increase the default resolution. But by how much?</p>

<p>It is recommended to have at least three resolution layers in the geometry feature 
when operations are performed. For fast level set, this can be set by the corresponding 
<tt>mgoals</tt> setting:</p>

<pre>
mgoals resolution=1.0/3.0
</pre>

<p>A different argument is used to control the full level-set resolution:</p>

<pre>
mgoals full.resolution=0.1
</pre>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.5"></a> 
<h1>1.5 When should I switch off the repair function (<tt>!repair</tt>) in 3D MGOALS?</h1>

<p>The repair function in the MGOALS module eliminates very small features in the 
geometry (slivers). Such small features can be the result of many simulation steps with 
numeric and round-off errors. By eliminating these small features, the load on 
Sentaurus Mesh is reduced and, therefore, the simulation success rate is increased. 
That is why this option is switched on by default.</p>

<p>The repair function works by encapsulating small features with the host material. 
Upon close examination of the resulting structures, you might notice some uneven patches, 
or scars, on the surfaces. In many cases, these should not have any detrimental effect on 
the simulation. However, in rare cases, these patches can result in complications in some 
operations, following the one when the repair was performed. In such cases, it can be 
beneficial to switch off the repair function by adding the flag <tt>!repair</tt> in that 
<tt>etch</tt> or <tt>deposit</tt> command.</p>

<p>An example is a sequence of an anisotropic operation, followed by an isotropic 
operation of the same material. The anisotropic operation might force geometry repair and 
create a patch on the material surface, and then as a result of the isotropic operation, 
this patch will grow. By switching off the repair function for the anisotropic operation, 
however, you can avoid this surface artifact.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.6"></a> 
<h1>1.6 Can user-defined geometry be combined with 3D MGOALS geometry?</h1>

<p>Yes, it can. There are two ways to do that. The external geometry can be 
either created outside of Sentaurus Process using Sentaurus Structure Editor and then loaded, 
or created on the fly and then incorporated into the structure.</p>

<p>You can create a structure in a standalone Sentaurus Structure Editor run and 
save the geometry as a TDR boundary file. Then, the geometry can be inserted by the 
following commands:</p>

<pre>
polyhedron name= &lt;MyPolyhedron&gt; tdr= &lt;name&gt;
insert polyhedron= &lt;MyPolyhedron&gt;
</pre>

<p>The first command imports the external geometry, and the second command 
incorporates it into the current structure.</p>

<p class="note">The inserted external object must be properly aligned with the 
Sentaurus Process structure. Users are responsible for placing the external 
geometry at the proper location with respect to the simulation structure when 
creating it.</p>

<p>In addition, polyhedra can be created internally in Sentaurus Process by using 
bricks or by specifying them point by point using the <tt>polyhedron</tt> command. 
For more details, refer to the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Process User Guide</cite>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.7"></a> 
<h1>1.7 How do I prepare process results for device simulation?</h1>

<p>Often, the mesh requirements for device simulation differ from those for 
process simulation since the equations solved are different. That is why it is 
advisable to create a new mesh starting from scratch as the final step in the 
process simulation. This usually involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clear the process simulation mesh:<br />
<pre>
refinebox clear
line clear
</pre></li>

<li>Set very high values for adaptive meshing parameters to deactivate any adaptation 
on doping profiles that can occur by default:<br />

<pre>
pdbSet Grid AdaptiveField Refine.Abs.Error 1e37 
pdbSet Grid AdaptiveField Refine.Rel.Error 1e10 
pdbSet Grid AdaptiveField Refine.Target.Length 100.0
</pre></li>

<li>Set high-quality Delaunay meshes:<br />

<pre>
pdbSet Grid SnMesh DelaunayType boxmethod
</pre></li>

<li>Set the interface spacing for the device mesh:<br />

<pre>
pdbSet Grid SnMesh min.normal.size &lt;n&gt;
pdbSet Grid SnMesh normal.growth.ratio.3d &lt;n&gt;
pdbSet Grid SnMesh max.box.angle.3d &lt;n&gt;
</pre></li>

<li>Set which interfaces will have interface meshes, for example, silicon:<br />

<pre>
refinebox interface.materials= {Silicon}
</pre></li>

<li>Switch on field adaptive refinement:<br />

<pre>
pdbSet Grid Adaptive 1
</pre></li>

<li>Specify lines if necessary:<br />

<pre>
line y location= $Ymin+0.001
line z location= $Zmin+0.001
</pre></li>

<li>Specify the refinement strategy, for example:<br />

<pre>
refinebox mask=Device_Active xtop=-0.05 xbot=0.2 \
  refine.fields= {NetActive} def.max.asinhdiff= 1.0 \
  refine.max.edge= &quot;0.02/$fd $PolyPitch/(8*$fd) $IsoPitch/(8.0*$fd)&quot; \
  refine.min.edge= &quot;0.005/$fd $PolyPitch/(16*$fd) $IsoPitch/(16.0*$fd)&quot; \
  adaptive Silicon add
  ...
</pre></li>
</ol>

<a name="1.8"></a> 
<h1>1.8 I have a layout in a specific format. Can it be used in Sentaurus Process?</h1>

<p>TCAD Sentaurus features an interface to the Synopsys layout editor Silicon WorkBench. 
It allows you to view and edit layouts in most of the industry-standard formats including 
GDSII and OASIS&reg;. One advantage of Silicon WorkBench over existing TCAD layout editors 
is its support of very large layout files through efficient memory management.</p>

<p>The files typically associated with the Silicon WorkBench layout interface in 
Sentaurus Process are the original layout file, the Sentaurus markup file, and the 
TCAD layout file. Silicon WorkBench stores TCAD-specific information in the markup 
file such as the simulation domain, stretch lines, and auxiliary layers, for the 
purpose of editing the markup information at a later time when needed. The layout 
information relevant to the TCAD Sentaurus tools is stored in the TCAD layout file.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.9"></a> 
<h1>1.9 Which type of mesh is needed for 3D diffusion simulations?</h1>

<p>Optimizing the number of grid points for a diffusion simulation is a very important task. 
On the one hand, you must ensure that you have an adequate mesh where it is needed. 
On the other hand, an excessive mesh can reduce the speed performance of the simulation. 
The optimum spacing is determined usually by how well you can capture segregation effects.</p>

<p>Based on previous experience, a 2&ndash;5&nbsp;nm interface spacing in the channel for 
CMOS technology simulations is a good starting point. One-dimensional simulations of 
the profiles in the important areas are very helpful to determine the adequate interface 
spacing.</p>

<p class="note">The maximum number of points produced by Sentaurus Mesh is set to 
500&thinsp;000 by default. In some cases, especially for large structures and 
complicated geometries, this might be insufficient and it is recommended that you 
increase this number, for example:<br /><br />
<tt>pdbSet Grid SnMesh MaxPoints 800000</tt></p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.10"></a> 
<h1>1.10 Which type  of mesh is needed for 3D mechanics simulations?</h1>

<p>The requirements for meshes to simulate mechanics effects are less stringent 
than those for diffusion simulation. For high-accuracy stress simulations, 
Delaunay-type meshes are not required. That is why constrained or conformal 
(default) delaunization with Sentaurus Mesh would be sufficient. It is also necessary 
to refine only the material interfaces for accurate mechanics simulations. A mesh 
spacing of 5&nbsp;nm is usually sufficient to accurately capture these effects. 
In rare cases, with structures having many details, you might need to use a smaller 
interface refinement but not below 1&nbsp;nm.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.11"></a> 
<h1>1.11 Which solver settings should I use for 3D simulations?</h1>

<p>The default settings are appropriate for most 3D simulations.</p>

<p>The solvers available in Sentaurus Process are:</p>

<ul>
<li>PARDISO applies a direct matrix inversion technique.</li>
<li>ILS uses an iterative scheme to solve the matrix equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The direct solver PARDISO is used by default in 1D and 2D mechanics simulations because 
of its robustness. However, direct solvers are usually memory intensive and slower 
than iterative ones, which is why the iterative solver ILS is used by default for 
all diffusion and 3D mechanics simulations.</p>

<p class="note"> The <tt>SetPerformanceMode</tt> command in Sentaurus Process helps 
to accelerate diffusion steps in a simulation.</p>

<p>For more information about solver settings, see 
<a href="../sd/sd_9.html#4">Section 9.4 Linear Solvers</a>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.12"></a> 
<h1>1.12 How many particles should I use for 3D Monte Carlo implantation simulations?</h1>

<p>It is very important in Monte Carlo implantation to choose the optimal number
of pseudoparticles for the simulation. In 3D simulations, by default, this
number is specified per 2500 nm<sup>2</sup> surface area. This number usually
varies between tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>


<p>The speed of the simulation depends on the implantation conditions and the number of 
particles. In general, tilted implantations of light elements can take a significant 
amount of time to perform, since there are many statistical events (for example, 
scattering and channeling) that must be taken into account.</p>

<p class="note">The number of pseudoparticles in a simulation is not the same 
as the real number of ions implanted in the structure. In practice, it is 
recommended to simulate pseudoparticles 1000 times the real number of implanted ions.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1.13"></a> 
<h1>1.13 What sort of speedup can I expect when using multithreading in 3D simulations?</h1>

<p>The main modules of  Sentaurus Process have been written and optimized 
to run in parallel.</p>

<h1>1.14 Can moving boundaries be simulated in three dimensions?</h1>

<p>Moving boundaries and the geometry modifications associated with them are 
among the most challenging tasks in three dimensions. Even though Sentaurus Process 
can simulate process steps such as oxidation and silicidation in three dimensions, 
it is not recommended for everyday simulations because simulation times 
can be long. Instead, such steps can be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If there is concern about some specific effects such as oxidation-enhanced 
diffusion, during diffusion, you can simulate 3D oxidation without moving 
boundaries by specifying:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetBoolean Grid DoNotMove.Reaction 1
</pre>

<p>When it is necessary to include the simulation of moving boundaries, you can use 
the experimental MovingMesh algorithm. MovingMesh performs local mesh transformation 
during moving-boundary operations in three dimensions (oxidation or silicidation):</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Grid Use.MovingMesh 1
</pre>

<p>MovingMesh relies on two internal algorithms DelPSC and MLS. DelPSC performs 
the actual mesh transformation, cleanup, and quality improvements. Several 
parameters control DelPSC operations, with the main ones being:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Apply.Brep.DelPSC 1
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Apply.Brep.DelPSC.Resolution &lt;n&gt;   ;# um
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Apply.Brep.DelPSC.Accuracy   &lt;n&gt;   ;# um
</pre>

<p>In rare cases, the moving-boundary geometry can develop some small features that will limit the 
robustness and the maximum-possible time step during the simulation. To avoid such situations, 
MLS is used to &quot;repair&quot; the geometry. The main criteria when to call MLS are:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Repair.Geometry.Min.Dihedral.Angle &lt;n&gt;
                                               ;# deg (typically 0.1)
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Repair.Geometry.Max.Face.Angle &lt;n&gt;
                                               ;# deg (typically 179.5)
</pre>

<p>Parameters that are used to control MLS typically include its resolution:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Repair.Geometry 1
pdbSet Grid MovingMesh Repair.Geometry.Resolution &lt;n&gt;   ;# um
</pre>

<p>To simplify the setting of all parameters related to MovingMesh, Sentaurus Process provides 
the command:</p>

<pre>
Set3DMovingMeshMode &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

<p>where <tt>&lt;n&gt;</tt> is usually the smallest layer thickness (in &mu;m) in the structure.</p>
