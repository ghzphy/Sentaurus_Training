<h1>4.1 Defining Doping Profiles</h1>

<p>Examples of the features discussed in this section are all contained in the 
Sentaurus Workbench project <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/Profiles</tt>. 
To work with the project, copy it to a local directory within your Sentaurus Workbench 
working directory.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Mesh integrates the following profile generation&ndash;related capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generating 1D, 2D, and 3D profiles (doping, lifetime, mole fraction, stress, and so on) 
using constant or analytic profile descriptions, which substitute the necessity of having the 
numerically simulated profiles. This gives you quick access to a device simulation where a 
resulting profile is represented by the superposition of constant or analytic profiles.</li>
<li>Having an interface between (2D or 3D) process and device simulators, allowing the transition of the 
doping profile from a process mesh to a mesh suitable for a device simulation.</li>
<li>Constructing a 3D doping profile from 2D numerically simulated profiles using 
a profile sweep, slice, and rotation.</li>
<li>Transferring a discrete doping profile, as a result of a kinetic Monte Carlo 
diffusion simulation, into a continuous doping profile to be used in a device 
electrical simulation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>4.2 Constant Profiles</h1>

<p>A constant profile can be confined within a material, a region, or an arbitrary geometric 
element.</p>

<p>The first example demonstrates the concept of the constant profile definition on a simple 
2D device structure, where the constant boron profile is confined within a rectangular window 
in the middle of the 2&nbsp;&mu;m x 2&nbsp;&mu;m silicon domain.</p>

profile decays. Click to view the command files for the following Sentaurus Mesh tool instances

section. For  details about the constant profile definition, refer to the

<h1>4.3 Analytic Profiles</h1>

<p>Analytic profiles are specified using a definition, a reference window, and a placement.</p> 

<p>The reference window is a directional line in two dimensions, and a rectangle or a polygon 
in three dimensions. The primary direction is the normal vector to the reference window, and 
the lateral direction is parallel to the reference window.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows the schematics of the local coordinate system and the valid domain. The valid 
domain for both the primary and lateral functions is defined by sweeping the primary direction 
vector along the lateral direction. For a 3D analytic profile definition, instead of a baseline, 
a primary plane (or polygon) is used to define the reference window.</p>

<p><img src="images/sm_aa_concept.png" width="568" height="371" 
alt="Concept of analytic profile definition" /></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Concept of analytic profile definition.</p>

<p>The syntax for an analytic profile definition in the <tt>Definitions</tt> section is:</p>

<pre>
AnalyticalProfile &quot;<em>reference name</em>&quot; {
  Species  = &quot;<em>Dataset Name</em>&quot;
  Function = Gauss(<em>parameters</em>) | Erf(<em>parameters</em>) | subMesh1D(<em>parameters</em>) | 
             Eval(<em>parameters</em>) | General(<em>parameters</em>)
  LateralFunction = Gauss(<em>parameters</em>) | Erf(<em>parameters</em>) |
                    Eval(<em>parameters</em>)
}
</pre>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Species</tt> indicates the species or variable name used for the analytic profile 
definition. Possible species names can be obtained from the <tt>datexcodes.txt</tt> file 
located in the <tt>$STROOT/tcad/$STRELEASE/lib</tt> directory.</li>
<li><tt>Function</tt> indicates the type of the component and its parameters used along the 
primary direction.</li>
<li><tt>LateralFunction</tt> defines the lateral component of the analytic profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details about the analytic profile specification, refer to the 
<cite>Sentaurus&trade; Mesh User Guide</cite>.</p>

<p>Figure 4 demonstrates analytic profile definitions for a simple 2D device. 
The 2D profile baseline is specified in the middle of the device, as indicated by 
the white arrow. The Gaussian profile distribution has been chosen for the profile 
primary direction. In these examples, the profile primary domain and the lateral function 
distributions vary. By default, Sentaurus Mesh applies the profile on both sides of 
the baseline. Therefore, there is no need for a direction specification in the 
<tt>Placements</tt> section.</p>

<h1>4.4 External Profiles</h1>

<p>External doping profiles from either process or device simulation results can be used 
to refine a mesh to make it suitable for a subsequent device simulation.</p>

<p>There are distinctive external profile definitions in Sentaurus Mesh:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>External 1D profiles</strong> can be used to construct 2D or 3D profiles 
using the analytic profile description (see <a href="#3">Section&nbsp;4.3 Analytic Profiles</a>). 
Instead of a Gaussian analytic profile, a 1D external doping profile is placed along 
the primary direction. For the lateral direction outside a primary domain, the same 
analytic functions are used.</li>
<li><strong>Submeshes</strong> have the same spatial dimension as a target device. 
The datasets defined on the external mesh then are interpolated to the newly generated mesh.</li>
</ul>

<!--==========================-->
<h2>4.4.1 External 1D Profiles</h2>

<p>The following example demonstrates how to incorporate an external 1D profile into 
a 2D device using the analytic profile description. The external 1D arsenic profile 
shown in Figure&nbsp;6 (<em>left</em>) is incorporated into the 2D device structure 
using the <tt>subMesh1D</tt> option:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/SubMeshes/SubMesh1d_msh.cmd" startExpr="*AnalyticalProfile*"  endExpr="*}*" header="Definitions { ..." footer="}" -->

    Function = subMesh1D(datafile = &quot;@pwd@/1d_As.plx&quot;, scale = 1)
    LateralFunction = Gauss(Factor = 0.2)
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The red arrow in Figure 6 (<em>right</em>) indicates the position of the 1D profile baseline. 
Outside the primary domain, the Gaussian profile distribution is used with a 0.2 factor with 
respect to the profile standard deviation along the primary direction.</p>

<h2>4.4.2 Submeshes</h2>

<p>The next example demonstrates how to incorporate a 2D external profile as a 
submesh to construct the mesh or doping profile suitable for device simulation. 
The Sentaurus Workbench project <tt>SubMeshes</tt> from the <tt>Applications_Library</tt> 
directory will be used here.</p>

<p>The goal of this example is to generate a mesh suitable for a device electrical simulation and to 
interpolate the doping and stress distributions from the original process grid onto the newly generated mesh. 
Due to the device symmetry, only half of the structure was simulated by Sentaurus Process (see the 
<a href="../sp/sp_menu.html">Sentaurus Process module</a>). The structure remeshing was performed using the 
<tt>SubMesh</tt> option:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/SubMeshes/SubMesh2d_msh.cmd" startExpr="*SubMesh*SubMesh*{"  endExpr="*}*" header="Definitions { ..." footer="}" -->
<pre>
Definitions { ...
  SubMesh &quot;SubMesh&quot; {
    Geofile = &quot;@pwd@/submesh_input2.tdr&quot;
  }
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Each individual dopant as well as stress components are interpolated from the original 
to the newly generated mesh. The original arsenic doping inside the poly gate is replaced 
by the constant doping using the <tt>Replace</tt> option:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/SubMeshes/SubMesh2d_msh.cmd" startExpr="*Constant*" startoccurrence=2 endExpr="*}*" endOccurrence=2 -->
<pre>
  Constant &quot;PlaceCD.Gate&quot; {
    Reference = &quot;Const.Gate&quot;
    Replace
    EvaluateWindow {
      Element = material [&quot;PolySi&quot;]
      DecayLength = 0
    }
  }
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The original grid and the resulting doping distribution after Sentaurus Process are 
shown in Figure&nbsp;7 (<em>left</em>). The resulting mesh and the doping distribution, 
ready for Sentaurus Device, are shown in Figure&nbsp;7 (<em>right</em>).</p>

<a name="Reflected"></a>
<p>To simulate the MOSFET device electrical behavior, the structure and 
mesh are mirrored at the x=0 axis location by Sentaurus Data Explorer, 
using the command:</p>

<pre>
tdx -mtt -x -ren drain=source test2d_half_subm_msh test2d_subm_msh
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the reflection capabilities of Sentaurus Mesh (see 
<a href="smesh_08.html#6">Section&nbsp;8.6 Reflection</a>).</p>

<p>This guarantees perfect mesh symmetry for the resulting device structure (see Figure&nbsp;8).</p>

alt="Mirrored device" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. Mirrored device. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>An important feature of the <tt>SubMesh</tt> option is how 
the profile extrapolation is handled when the <tt>SubMesh</tt> 
domain and the target device geometries do not match 
(see Figure 9 (<em>left</em>)). In this case, Sentaurus Mesh 
extrudes all profiles outside the <tt>SubMesh</tt> domain, having them 
uniformly distributed, as shown in Figure 9 (<em>right</em>).</p>

<!--==========================-->
<h2>4.4.3 Material-Matching Options for Submeshes</h2>

<p>The next example demonstrates the use of the <tt>Ignoremat</tt> option of <tt>SubMesh</tt>.</p>

<p>The standard behavior of submesh interpolation is that the interpolation occurs only if the 
mesh vertex in a target device belongs to the same material as in a submesh device. If materials 
in a submesh device and a target device at the same vertex location are different, the profile interpolation 
for this vertex is suppressed. To overcome this limitation, you can specify <tt>Ignoremat</tt> 
in a submesh <tt>Placements</tt> section, which instructs Sentaurus Mesh to allow a profile 
interpolation, regardless of whether the materials match or do not match:</p>

<pre>
Placements {...
  SubMesh &quot;SubMesh&quot; {
    Reference = &quot;SubMesh&quot;
    Ignoremat
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Figure 10 demonstrates this behavior. The remeshing is performed for the target device, which 
differs from the submesh device by having a polysilicon region in the middle of the structure 
instead of silicon.</p>

<p><a href="images/sm_aa_remesh.png"><img src="images/sm_aa_remesh.png" 
width="570" alt="Test cases showing effect of Ignoremat" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 10. Test cases showing effect of Ignoremat option. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>Figure 11 shows the results of interpolation. The submesh device is uniformly doped with 
boron (left image). By default, Sentaurus Mesh suppresses the doping interpolation inside the 
polysilicon material for the target device (middle image). Switching on the <tt>Ignoremat</tt> option 
activates the interpolation inside nonmatching materials and produces exactly the same profile as in 
the submesh (right image).</p>

<p><a href="images/sm_aa_ignoremat.png"><img src="images/sm_aa_ignoremat.png" width="570" 
alt="(Left) SubMesh device with uniform 1e16 B doping distribution, (middle) target device showing Sentaurus Mesh default interpolation behavior, and (right) demonstration of Ignoremat behavior" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 11. (Left) Submesh device with uniform 1e16 boron doping distribution, 
(middle) target device showing Sentaurus Mesh default interpolation behavior and boron concentration 
inside polysilicon is suppressed, and (right) demonstration of Ignoremat behavior and boron doping is 
also interpolated inside polysilicon material. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>Besides the submesh interpolation schemes previously described, you can specify 
the option <tt>MatchMaterialType</tt>:</p>

<pre>
Placements {...
  SubMesh &quot;SubMesh&quot; {
    Reference = &quot;SubMesh&quot;
    MatchMaterialType
  }
}
</pre>

<p>When <tt>MatchMaterialType</tt> is specified, the submesh attempts to match equivalent material types 
(for example, semiconductor-semiconductor, insulator-insulator, conductor-conductor) instead 
of trying to match material names when looking up values from which to interpolate.</p>

<p>The last example illustrates the Sentaurus Mesh capability to remesh the device, using the 
previously obtained device simulation result taken as a submesh.</p>

<p>It often happens that a device needs remeshing after device simulation, based on a solution 
of a certain carrier transport task. In this example, the remeshing is based on the profile 
of the carrier impact ionization rate, obtained on a coarse mesh (see Figure&nbsp;12 (<em>left</em>)). 
The peak ionization rate appears to be in a region with the coarse mesh that needs to be remeshed. 
This solution is taken as a submesh, then the mesh refinement based on the impact ionization 
values within a given range is used as a refinement criterion together with the mesh 
refinement on doping:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/SubMeshes/SubMesh2dII_msh.cmd" startExpr="Definitions*"  endExpr="*}*" footer="  ...\n}" -->
<pre>
Definitions {
  Refinement &quot;Default Region&quot; {
    MaxElementSize = (1 1 )
    MinElementSize = (0.05 0.05 )
    RefineFunction = MaxInterval(
      Variable = &quot;ImpactIonization&quot;, 
      cmin=1e20, cmax=1e30, targetLength=0.05, 
      scaling=1, rolloff
    )
    RefineFunction = MaxTransDiff(Variable=&quot;DopingConcentration&quot;, Value=1)
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The option is activated with the <tt>MaxInterval</tt> keyword, where <tt>Variable</tt> 
defines the dataset field name, on which the mesh refinement is produced. <tt>cmin</tt> 
and <tt>cmax</tt> define the interval values to be considered by the refinement procedure. 
The algorithm analyzes each edge in a refinement tree cell and refines the edge if the data 
values at the endpoints overlap a given interval and the edge is longer than the maximum 
edge length, defined by the <tt>targetLength</tt> value, which sets the constant mesh 
resolution within the given range of field values. The coarser value between 
<tt>MinElementSize</tt> and <tt>targetLength</tt> is used in this case.</p>

<p>With <tt>rolloff</tt> switched on, the scaling parameter value determines how the mesh 
step transition towards the outside of the refinement domain is applied, according to the 
following formula:</p>

<pre>
targetLengthOutside = targetLength*(1 + log(Ca) - log(Cb))^2 * scaling
</pre>

<p>where <tt>Ca</tt> and <tt>Cb</tt> are the variable values at the endpoints of the edge.</p>

<p>The resulting mesh, shown in Figure 12 (<em>right</em>), demonstrates the finer mesh 
refinement within the area with large values of the impact ionization rate and large 
doping profile gradients.</p>

<h1>4.5 Three-Dimensional Doping Profile Construction</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Mesh allows different 2D profile transformations such as rotation, extrusion, 
and sweeping. It is also possible to sweep a 2D geometry and a 2D profile along the same 
path simultaneously and to apply a similar sweep to the mesh refinement window for a more 
accurate mesh spatial discretization of a device.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the different techniques of 1D 
or 2D profile incorporation into a 3D device structure by applying several 
profile transformations, including 1D to 2D profile transfer, 2D profile 
rotation, extrusion, and sweeping.</p>

<p>The Sentaurus Mesh command files featured in this section are 
in the Sentaurus Workbench project <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/ProfileConstruction3D</tt>. 
To work with the project, start Sentaurus Workbench and copy the project 
<tt>ProfileConstruction3D</tt> to a local directory within the Sentaurus 
Workbench working directory.</p>

<p>As the first step, the 2D profile is created from the <tt>SubMesh1d</tt> 
profile using the analytic profile specification:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/ProfileConstruction3D/one2two_msh.cmd" startExpr="Definitions*" endExpr="*}*" footer="  ...\n}" -->
<pre>
Definitions {
  AnalyticalProfile &quot;AnalyticalProfileDefinition_1&quot; {
    Function = subMesh1D(datafile = &quot;@pwd@/1d_As.plx&quot;, scale = 1)
    LateralFunction = Gauss(Factor = 0.0)
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

  }
  ...

<p class="caption">Figure 13. (Left) One-dimensional doping profile and (right) 2D profile.

<p>In the second step, the 2D profile is incorporated into the 3D domain using 
a combination of different submesh placements, involving a profile shift as well as 
rotation, sweeping, and replacement techniques (see Figure 14).</p>

<h1>4.6 General Function Evaluator</h1>

<p>Apart from the predefined Gaussian and error functions, you can define an arbitrary 
general analytic function that can be used to define primary and lateral profile distributions 
for analytic profile definitions. The general function evaluator (GFE) uses the following
syntax:</p>

<pre>
AnalyticalProfile &quot;reference name&quot; {
  Function = General(init=&quot;variable assignments&quot;, 
                     function=&quot;evaluated expression&quot;, 
                     value=&lt;default_return_value&gt;)
  LateralFunction = General(init = &quot;variable assignments&quot;, 
                            function = &quot;evaluated expression&quot;)
}
</pre>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>init</tt> is a semicolon-separated list of assignments for variables that are 
used in the <tt>Function</tt> expression.</li>
<li><tt>function</tt> is an expression that is evaluated for every query.</li>
<li><tt>value</tt> is the default return value if the evaluation fails.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first example demonstrates the application of the GFE to construct a linearly 
graded doping profile. For the structure in Figure 18, the linearly graded phosphorus doping
profile is defined inside the SiGe region, which is sandwiched between two uniformly doped 
silicon regions.</p>

<p>This example is contained in the Sentaurus Workbench project 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/EvaluateFunction</tt>.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 18. Test structure showing linear doping.</p>

<p>The following syntax specifies a linearly graded profile inside 
the SiGe region:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/EvaluateFunction/linear_msh.cmd" startExpr="Definitions*" endExpr="*}*" footer="  ...\n}" -->
<pre>
Definitions {
  AnalyticalProfile &quot;linear&quot; {
    Species = &quot;PhosphorusActiveConcentration&quot;
    Function = General( init = &quot;fmax=10^18;fmin=10^16&quot;  
        function = &quot;10.*(fmin-fmax)*x+2.*fmax-fmin&quot; value = 0)
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The <tt>function</tt> expression ensures that the profile values at the outer 
boundaries of the SiGe layer meet the specified boundary conditions: 1e18&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup> 
at x = 0.1&nbsp;&mu;m and 1e16&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup> at x = 0.2&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>

layers1_dvs.cmd</a>. Sentaurus Structure Editor uses this command file 
to produce such boundary and meshing command files and build the mesh.</p>

<p>The next example illustrates the use of the GFE to produce an automatic mesh refinement on 
an arbitrary function. In this example, the test profile is specified using the GFE:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/EvaluateFunction/GFEmesh_msh.cmd" startExpr="*AnalyticProfile*" endExpr="*}*" -->
<pre>
  AnalyticProfile &quot;gfe_profile&quot; {
    Species = &quot;P2&quot;
    Function = General(init=&quot;c0=10^5;lx=0.1;ly=0.1;lz=0.1&quot;,
               function=&quot;c0/exp((x/lx)^2)/exp((y/ly)^2)/exp((z/lz)^2)&quot;)
  }
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The example uses the species called <tt>&quot;P2&quot;</tt>, which is declared in the 
<tt>$STROOT/tcad/$STRELEASE/lib/datexcodes.txt</tt> file. The mesh refinement is based on 
the <tt>&quot;P2&quot;</tt> test profile distribution. The test 3D profile distribution 
and the final 3D mesh are shown in Figure&nbsp;20.</p>

<h1>4.7 Profile Overlap Controls</h1>
     
<p>By default, the specified profiles are superimposed when they overlap. Switching on the 
<tt>Replace</tt> option allows you to change this behavior. In this case, the order in which 
profiles are placed is important. The next example demonstrates the use of the profile overlap 
controls. Three constant profiles are introduced that overlap (see Figure&nbsp;21).</p>

<p><img src="images/sm_aa_overlap.png" width="403" height="403" 
alt="Background constant boron doping profile" /></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 21. &quot;prof1&quot; is the background constant boron doping profile 
with 1e16&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup> concentration; &quot;prof2&quot; is the constant boron doping profile with 
1e18&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup> concentration; and &quot;prof3&quot; is the constant arsenic doping profile with 
1e18&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup> concentration.</p>

<p>Figure 22 shows the resulting doping profile distributions 
(Nr&nbsp;=&nbsp;Ndonor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Nacceptor), illustrating the 
Sentaurus Mesh behavior when different overlap control scenarios are used:</p>

<ul>
<li>For Scenario A, the profile order, that is, how they appear in the <tt>Placements</tt> section 
of the command file, corresponds to the profile numbering, together with the default rule for 
profile overlay, which requires a profile sum at any spatial mesh vertex position. Therefore, 
for the area where high-doped boron and arsenic doping profiles overlap, the resulting doping 
profile concentration is equal to the background low-doped boron concentration (shown in light blue).</li>

<li>For Scenario B, the same profile order is used as in Scenario A but the <tt>Replace</tt> 
option is specified for the <tt>prof2</tt> profile. Therefore, the <tt>prof2</tt> profile replaces 
the previously placed <tt>prof1</tt> profile and then is overlapped with the <tt>prof3</tt> profile, 
which results in zero net doping concentration within the overlay region (shown in green).</li>

<li>Scenario C differs from Scenario B by adding the <tt>Replace</tt> option to the <tt>prof3</tt> 
profile specification. In this case, the <tt>prof3</tt> profile replaces both underlying boron 
profiles, as can be seen from the image.</li>

<li>For Scenario D, the order, that is, how the profiles <tt>prof2</tt> and <tt>prof3</tt> appear in 
the command file, is changed compared to Scenario C, which results in the <tt>prof2</tt> profile
winning over other profiles.</li>

<h1>4.8 Doping Naming Conventions</h1>

<p>Transferring doping profiles from Sentaurus Process to Sentaurus Device using the 
Sentaurus Mesh <tt>SubMesh</tt> option is relatively straightforward. However, the doping 
profile compilation with constant or analytic profiles requires a certain naming convention 
to guarantee that profiles are handled properly by the device simulator.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Mesh uses <em>active</em> donor and acceptor dopants to calculate the resulting 
(net) doping profile (<tt>Nr</tt>):</p>

<pre>
Nr = Sum(Nd) - Sum(Na)
</pre>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Sum()</tt> is the sum of all present dopants of either donor or acceptor type for 
each mesh vertex spatial location inside the device structure.</li>
<li><tt>Nd</tt> is an active donor dopant concentration.</li>
<li><tt>Na</tt> is an active acceptor dopant concentration.</li>
</ul>

<p>For silicon material as well as for other semiconductors from group IV of 
the periodic table of elements, special names are reserved for donor and acceptor dopants, 
which are defined in the <tt>$STROOT/tcad/$STRELEASE/lib/datexcodes.txt</tt> file.</p>

<p>For donor dopants, the most important names are:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>AntimonyActiveConcentration</tt></li>
<li><tt>ArsenicActiveConcentration</tt></li> 
<li><tt>PhosphorusActiveConcentration</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>For acceptor dopants, the most important names are:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>AluminumActiveConcentration</tt></li>
<li><tt>BerylliumActiveConcentration</tt></li>
<li><tt>BoronActiveConcentration</tt></li>
<li><tt>IndiumActiveConcentration</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>While constructing doping profiles, Sentaurus Mesh calculates the resulting
(net) doping profile applying the previous formula and saves individual dopants and
the resulting doping profile in a TDR file. For each individual dopant, its
profile is interpolated to a final mesh. However, for a resulting doping
profile, the following rules apply:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a dopant is defined that has one of the mentioned names, it is used for a 
resulting doping profile calculation.</li>
<li>If there are no profiles with the mentioned <tt>*ActiveConcentration</tt>
names, Sentaurus Mesh checks whether there are corresponding profiles with total
concentrations <tt>*Concentration</tt>, for example 
<tt>PhosphorusConcentration</tt>, and uses them to calculate a resulting doping
profile.</li>
<li>If a profile called <tt>DopingConcentration</tt> is specified in the command file, 
it is summed with the resulting doping profile calculated with the previous formula.</li>
<li>If there are dopants with the names <tt>NDopantActiveConcentration</tt> or 
<tt>PDopantActiveConcentration</tt> defined, they are used as donor and acceptor dopants, 
respectively, in the resulting doping calculation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter rule allows you to specify the doping distribution for III&ndash;V or II&ndash;VI 
semiconductor materials, such as GaAs and HgTe, and their compounds.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate these naming conventions. The same structure 
and profile definitions as in the example in 
<a href="#7">Section&nbsp;4.7 Profile Overlap Controls</a> are used here.</p>

<p>Four cases with different profile names were defined (see Figure 23):</p>

<ul>
<li>For Example 1, all profiles are defined as active. These values indicate the resulting 
doping concentration at each profile location. The background net doping concentration within 
the area indicated as <tt>prof1</tt> is negative, since only <tt>BoronActiveConcentration</tt> 
doping (acceptor type) is specified there. For overlapping profiles, the doping superposition is 
applied according to the above formula.</li>

<li>For Example 2, the <tt>BoronConcentration</tt> species name has been chosen for the <tt>prof1</tt> 
profile instead of <tt>BoronActiveConcentration</tt>, as in Example&nbsp;1. Since there are still 
active dopant specifications defined for the <tt>prof2</tt> and <tt>prof3</tt> profiles, the 
<tt>prof1</tt> profile definition is ignored when the resulting doping profile calculation is 
performed (you can see that the doping profile value inside the <tt>prof1</tt> domain is zero).</li>

<li>For Example 3, the species name for the <tt>prof1</tt> doping profile is 
<tt>DopingConcentration</tt>. Therefore, the resulting net doping is calculated according to 
Rule&nbsp;3 as a superposition of the individual active dopants and the <tt>prof1</tt> doping 
profile.</li>

<li>For Example 4, the <tt>NDopantActiveConcentration</tt> and <tt>PDopantActiveConcentration</tt> 
names are used instead of <tt>BoronActiveConcentration</tt> and <tt>ArsenicActiveConcentration</tt> 
to define the doping profile. As can be seen, such definitions produce exactly the same resulting 
doping profile, as in Example&nbsp;1.</li>
</ul>

<h1>4.9 Discrete-to-Continuous Dopant Profile Transition</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Mesh can create continuous doping profiles from discrete dopant distributions 
obtained using Sentaurus Process Kinetic Monte Carlo (Sentaurus Process KMC), which then 
can be used in device simulations.</p>

<p>Such a procedure is called <em>deatomization</em>, which is accomplished 
by associating a doping function with each discrete dopant. The union of all such 
doping functions defines the final doping profile.</p>

<p>The next example demonstrates the doping deatomization procedure. A 3D MOS 
transistor structure and atomized KMC species are shown in Figure&nbsp;24. Note the 
Manhattan-type geometry of the originally rounded shapes, which is the result of 
using a tensor grid in the Sentaurus Process KMC simulation.</p>

<p><a href="images/sm_aa_kmc.png">
<img src="images/sm_aa_kmc.png" width="400" alt="Result of 3D KMC simulation" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 24. Result of 3D KMC simulation showing locations of the KMC species. 
Blue points indicate the location of single atom defects, mostly dopants. Cyan points indicate 
the location of impurity clusters. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The discrete KMC results are loaded into Sentaurus Mesh where they are deatomized 
using a normalized charge density approach. The charge density functions for all 
dopants are then summed to form the final doping distribution to be used in a subsequent 
device simulation.</p>

<p>To deatomize the KMC dopants, the <tt>Particle</tt> section must be declared 
inside the <tt>Definitions</tt> section of the Sentaurus Mesh command file for each 
individual dopant. The following syntax illustrates the parameters of the <tt>Particle</tt> 
section to deatomize boron particles:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/snmesh/Deatomization/KMC_msh.cmd" startExpr="*Particle*"  endExpr="*}*" -->
<pre>
  Particle &quot;BoronParticles&quot; {
    ParticleFile = &quot;@pwd@/kmc_final.tdr&quot;
    Species = &quot;BoronActiveConcentration&quot;
    ScreeningFactor = 3.5e6
    AutoScreeningFactor
    Normalization
  }
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>ParticleFile</tt> indicates the location of the source for the boron particles 
profile, which is deatomized into <tt>BoronActiveConcentration</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>ScreeningFactor</tt> is the inverse of the screening length used for a 
profile deatomization.</li>
<li><tt>AutoScreeningFactor</tt> switches on an automatic screening factor calculation 
for each discrete dopant based on the local density of dopants.</li>
<li><tt>Normalization</tt> switches on the doping normalization for discrete dopants, 
whose doping function extends beyond the boundary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Mesh User Guide</cite> for details.</p>
