<h2 class="obj">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
 <li>To start the graphical user interface and to perform basic operations 
in the TCAD Sentaurus&ndash;Silicon WorkBench interface.</li> 
</ul>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="1"></a>
<h1>1.1 Strategy</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Process can read GDS layout files directly as shown in 
<a href="../sp/sp_14.html">Section&nbsp;14. Special Focus: Using Mask Information From GDSII Files</a>, 
or you can use the Silicon WorkBench graphical user interface (GUI) 
to prepare the layout information and to declare the simulation domains. Additional 
information that makes the process simulation setup more convenient can be supplied.</p>

<p>In this module, the following strategy is applied:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>The GDS file is loaded into the GUI. A mapping of layer numbers to layer 
names is performed and is saved for later use.</li>
<li>Auxiliary layers are defined.</li>
<li>Simulation domains are defined.</li>
<li>Information is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench in the directory 
<tt> Applications_Library/GettingStarted/siwb/siwb_for_process</tt>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="2"></a>
<h1>1.2 Starting the Graphical User Interface</h1>

<p>You can start the GUI from the command line with:</p>

<pre>
siwb
</pre>

<p>To load a GDS file, choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open</strong>. 
An example is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>For a detailed description of Silicon WorkBench functionality, choose 
<strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Documentation</strong>. This links to the user 
documentation.</p>

<p>In this section, only functionality relating to layout information in process 
simulation is discussed.</p>

<p class="note">Even though this section discusses how to use Silicon WorkBench, other 
Synopsys layout editors, IC WorkBench Edit/View Plus and IC Validator WorkBench, can 
provide the same functionality for TCAD purposes. If you use IC WorkBench Edit/View Plus, 
then you must set the appropriate environment variable. In a Linux C shell, this can be 
performed on the command line or in the <tt>.cshrc</tt> file:<br /><br />

<tt>setenv ICWBEV_USER SENTAURUS</tt><br /><br />

and the command to start the tool is <tt>icwbev</tt>. Similarly, if you use IC Validator 
WorkBench, then the environment variable to set is <tt>ICVWB_USER</tt> and the command 
to start the tool is <tt>icvwb</tt>.</p>

<h1>1.3 Renaming Layers</h1>

<p>The original GDS file contains numbered layout layers. For a TCAD simulation, 
this is not convenient, and most users want to address layers by names. 
The mapping of layer numbers is performed by clicking in the window with the 
layout layers and adding the corresponding name, as shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>

<p><a href="images/ic_layoutlayers.png"><img src="images/ic_layoutlayers.png" width="570" 
alt="Numbered layers and renamed layers" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. (Left) Numbered layers and (right) renamed layers. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The mapping of layer numbers to layer names must be saved. To save the mapping:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Sentaurus Export</strong> button 
<img class="imgline" src="images/icons/savemarkup.png" width="45" height="57" 
alt="Sentaurus Export button" />.<br /> 
The Sentaurus Export dialog box opens.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Markups</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Active layout</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Output file</strong> field, enter the name of the file.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is convenient to save the file with a <tt>.tcl</tt> or <tt>.mac</tt> extension 
because these are predefined file filters when reading or writing files in Silicon WorkBench. 
The file that is saved this way is an ASCII file, which looks like:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/siwb/siwb_for_process/BiCMOS_mkp.mac" startLine=3 endLine=9 format="wrap"-->
<pre>
default winding 1
layout open ./BICMOSinverter.gds Inverter
cell transform 1.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0
layer add 1:0
layer configure 1:0 -name NWELL -fill #00ff00 -pattern fill12-a -outline \
  #00ff00 -lineStyle solid -lineWidth 1 
layer add 2:0
layer configure 2:0 -name NPDIFF -fill #0000ff -pattern fill12-b -outline \
  #0000ff -lineStyle solid -lineWidth 1 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>This file contains the absolute path to the original GDS file and the mapping 
of layer numbers to layer names. Therefore, you can read this file into the Silicon WorkBench 
GUI instead of loading the GDS file. In many cases, however, the correspondence of layer 
numbers to layer names is the same for many GDS files. You can delete the first lines 
of this file (until <tt>cell transform</tt>) and keep only the lines starting with 
<tt>layer configure</tt>. Then, this file can be read after a GDS file has been loaded 
into the GUI. Finally, a file containing the layer numbers and the corresponding 
layer names can be created manually. The display options can be omitted:</p>

<pre>
layer configure 1:0 -name NWELL
layer configure 2:0 -name NPDIFF
</pre>

<h1>1.4 Creating Auxiliary Layers</h1>

<p>In a TCAD simulation flow, it is often helpful to create additional layers and to use 
these as masks. A GDS file usually has layers for metallization, but these layers do not 
distinguish between different contacts such as source, gate, and drain. In a TCAD 
simulation, however, it is essential to have that information.</p>

<p>To add this information to the layout, you can add auxiliary layers containing several polygons. To add a new layer:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Tree View pane, right-click <strong>Layout Layers</strong> and choose 
<strong>New Layer</strong>.<br />
The New Layer dialog box opens.</li>
<li>Assign a layer number and a layer name, and select a fill pattern and a color for the polygons. 
Then, click <strong>OK</strong> to close the dialog box.</li>
<li>Draw polygons by selecting the <strong>Polygon</strong> toolbar button on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab.</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 3 shows the part of a layout that contains an NMOS transistor. Three new layers 
have been added: nsource, ngate, and ndrain. With this, contacts can be assigned easily 
in Sentaurus Process, and no changes are necessary if a different simulation domain 
is chosen. </p>

<p><a href="images/ic_auxlayers.png"><img src="images/ic_auxlayers.png" 
width="570" alt="Main window of Silicon WorkBench showing auxiliary layers" /></a></p> 

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Introducing auxiliary layers: NMOS part of a layout 
is shown, and additional layers are introduced for the source, drain, and gate 
contacts. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>It is not necessary that these additional polygons are defined everywhere in the 
layout (as in the previous example, you do not need to create polygons for all 
contacts in the layout). It is only necessary to define them in regions in which 
TCAD simulations are performed (the TCAD simulation domains).</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="5"></a>
<h1>1.5 Using Boolean Operations</h1>

<p>Silicon WorkBench supports the use of Boolean operations, which can be helpful 
when creating auxiliary layers, for example. Boolean operations are used with the 
Tcl/Tk programming language. The logical <em>and</em> operation of two layers, 
for example, is:</p>

<pre>
set L1 [bop extract -layers 20]
set L2 [bop extract -layers 21]
set L1andL2 [bop and $L1 $L2]
bop insert $L1andL2 30
</pre>

<p>Here, layer <tt>20</tt> is assigned to the variable <tt>L1</tt> and layer <tt>21</tt> 
is assigned to the variable <tt>L2</tt>. The third line performs the logical <em>and</em> 
operation of layers <tt>L1</tt> and <tt>L2</tt>, and assigns the result to the variable 
<tt>L1andL2</tt>. The last line adds the result as layer <tt>30</tt> to the current layout.</p> 

<p>For information about the use of Booleans, refer to the Silicon WorkBench 
documentation (choose <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Documentation</strong>).</p>

<p>The layout must be flat to allow for Boolean operations. If the layout is hierarchical, 
then type <tt>hierarchy explode</tt> in the Command Pane of the GUI.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>1.6 Using Stretches</h1>

<p>Silicon WorkBench supports the use of stretches. A stretch is a line in the layout 
perpendicular to which the layout can be stretched.</p>

<p>Such a stretch is introduced by clicking the <strong>Stretch</strong> button 
<img class="imgline" src="images/icons/stretch.png" width="46" height="55" alt="Stretch icon" /> 
and drawing a horizontal or vertical stretch line in the layout (see Figure 4). 
The stretch is named automatically. It can be renamed in the list of open cells. 
The exact coordinates can be specified there as well.</p>

<p><a href="images/ic_stretch.png"><img src="images/ic_stretch.png" width="570" 
alt="Part of a layout with a stretch" /></a></p> 

<p class="caption">Figure 4. Part of a layout showing a stretch; black arrow indicates 
the positive direction of stretch values. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The stretch utility applies the stretch to all mask layers. The effect is illustrated in 
Figure 5 in which a gate length variation is simulated. If you want to apply a stretch only 
to one layer, see <a href="ic_2.html#1">Section&nbsp;2.1 Defining the Process Simulation Domain</a>.</p>

<p><a href="images/ic_stretch_para.png"><img src="images/ic_stretch_para.png" width="570" 
alt="Stretch=0.0 and Stretch=1.0" /></a></p> 

<p class="caption">Figure 5. Parameterizing a simulation using a stretch that is applied 
to the middle of the gate mask. (Left) With a stretch value of 0.0, the original mask is 
used. (Right) With a stretch value of 1.0, all mask edges with a coordinate right of the 
middle of the gate are moved by 1.0 &mu;m. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="7"></a>
<h1>1.7 Defining Simulation Domains</h1>

<p>You can define 1D, 2D, and 3D TCAD simulation domains. They are called point, gauge, 
and highlight, respectively, and can be drawn into the layout by selecting the 
appropriate button from the toolbar:</p>
 
<p><img class="imgline" src="images/icons/point.png" width="35" height="53" alt="Point icon" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img class="imgline" src="images/icons/gauge.png" width="42" height="55" alt="Gauge icon" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img class="imgline" src="images/icons/highlight.png" width="57" height="57" alt="Highlight icon" /></p>

<p>In most cases, you will draw the simulation domains at their approximate positions. 
The exact coordinates can be specified in the list of open cells (see Figure 6). 
The names of the simulation domains also can be changed there.</p>

<p class="note">It is recommended not to let simulation domains coincide with mask edges.</p>

alt="Part of a layout with several simulation domains" /></a></p> 

<p class="caption">Figure 6. Part of a layout with several simulation domains: 
the exact coordinates and the names of simulation domains and stretch lines 
can be specified in the list of open cells in the Tree View pane. (Click image for 
full-size view.)</p>

<h1>1.8 Saving Information</h1>

<p>After all the steps described in the previous sections, two files should be saved: 
one file that contains all of the above information and can be used for a restart at 
this step, and one file that can be used with Sentaurus Process.</p>

<p>The first file, the <em>Sentaurus markup file</em>, contains the mapping 
of layer numbers to layer names, the auxiliary layers, and the TCAD simulation 
domains. The name of the original layout file and the absolute path to it are saved 
in this markup file, so it is sufficient to load only  this file if changes need 
to be made.</p>

<p>To save a markup file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Sentaurus Export</strong> button.<br />
The Sentaurus Export dialog box opens.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Markups</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have added auxiliary layers, then select <strong>Include new layers</strong>.<br />
The original GDSII file will not be changed.</li>
<li>To open a specific layout file when reloading the markup file, select 
<strong>Open a layout file</strong>:<br />
(a) <strong>Active layout</strong>: Select this option when using a centrally located 
GDSII layout. This option is particularly useful when working with a very large full-chip layout.<br />
(b) <strong>Layout</strong>: Select this option when working with an edited or a local 
version of the GDSII layout. Specify the name of the layout.</li>
<li>Enter the file name in the <strong>Output file</strong> field.<br />
The recommended extension for this file is <tt>_mkp.mac</tt>.</li>
<li> Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second file, the <em>TCAD layout file</em>, is used to exchange 
layout information between Silicon WorkBench and TCAD Sentaurus. This file is 
flat and does not contain a reference to the GDSII file. It is a small file 
because it contains only the parts of the layout needed for TCAD Sentaurus.</p>

<p>To save this file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Sentaurus Export</strong> button.<br />
The Sentaurus Export dialog box opens.</li>
<li>Select <strong>TCAD layout</strong>.</li>
<li>A layer in a layout can be defined by a large number of touching or overlapping 
polygons. It is recommended to merge all these polygons into a smaller number of 
possibly more complex polygons by selecting <strong>Merge shapes</strong>.</li>
<li>For better viewing, layers are padded by 10 nm. To change this value, 
edit the <strong>Margin</strong> field.</li>
<li>Enter the file name in the <strong>Output file</strong> field.<br />
The recommended extension for this file is <tt>_lyt.mac</tt>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">You can reload and edit the markup file (<tt>*_mkp.mac</tt>) as needed. 
The TCAD layout file (<tt>*_lyt.mac</tt>), however, should be reloaded for viewing only 
(for example, for debugging purposes). Editing and resaving the TCAD layout will result 
in duplication of polygons.<br /><br />
Since the markup file contains the full path to the GDSII file, you will 
need to edit the markup file if you move the GDSII file or if you rename the directory 
containing the markup file.</p>
