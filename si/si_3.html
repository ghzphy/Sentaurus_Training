<h2 class="obj">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
 <li>To perform a 3D mechanics simulation of a cantilever with an end load.</li>
</ul>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>3.1 Overview</h1>

<p>In this example, Sentaurus Interconnect will solve a simple case of a cantilever 
with an end load (see <a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>). The cantilever is fully clamped 
at one end, and a point force is applied to the other end. No other loads or 
boundary conditions (BCs) are applied, and the entire structure is free to move 
under the effect of the applied force (except, of course, the clamped end).</p>

<p>The cantilever is expected to bend slightly on the xz plane with a maximum displacement 
\(δ_{\text"max"}\) at the end where the point force is applied, which is given by the 
analytic model (valid only for small displacements, that is, the linear regime):</p>

<p>\[δ_{\text"max"} = 4 {P L^{3}} / {E α^4} \] </p>

<p>where \(E\) is Young's modulus, \(P\) is the point force, \(L\) is 
the length of the cantilever, and \(α\) is the edge of the square cross-section of the 
cantilever.</p>

<p>The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench in the directory 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever</tt>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="2"></a>
<h1>3.2 Creating the 3D Structure and Its Mesh</h1>

<p>In this section, you define the 3D structure of the cantilever and the meshing. 
The cantilever has a 4&times;4&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> square cross-section and 
is 50&nbsp;&mu;m long (set by the Sentaurus Workbench parameter <tt>@1@</tt>). 
This is performed using <tt>line</tt> commands to define the boundaries of the 
structure in the three basic directions: x, y, and z.</p>

<p>The main axis of the cantilever is oriented parallel to the x-axis with the 
center of its cross section along the line <tt>y=0</tt> <tt>z=0</tt>. The initial 
meshing of the structure is achieved by specifying <tt>spacing=&lt;n&gt;</tt> of 
the <tt>line</tt> command. The exact placement of the lines is done by 
<tt>location=&lt;n&gt;</tt>, and the default unit is &mu;m. Tags can be used to 
identify the lines of interest by specifying <tt>tag=&lt;c&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p class="note">These tags are not related in any way to the tags used later 
to set the BCs.</p>

<p>Finally, the grid definition section looks like this:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - lines" endExpr="##end - lines" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
line x location= 0.0&lt;um&gt;  spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;   tag= top
line x location= @l@&lt;um&gt;  spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;   tag= bottom
line y location= -2.0&lt;um&gt; spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;   tag= left
line y location= 0.0&lt;um&gt;  spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;
line y location= 2.0&lt;um&gt;  spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;   tag= right
line z location= -2.0&lt;um&gt; spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;   tag= back
line z location= 0.0&lt;um&gt;  spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;
line z location= 2.0&lt;um&gt;  spacing= @res@&lt;um&gt;   tag= front
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The Sentaurus Workbench parameter <tt>@res@</tt> sets the global spacing of the 
grid, and the default value in the project is 0.3 &mu;m. This spacing value can be 
changed slightly up or down, depending on the global size of the simulation 
domain and the initial grid division by Sentaurus Mesh. <a href="#Fig2">Figure&nbsp;2</a> 
shows the meshed 3D model along with the orientation of the coordinate system.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<h2>3.2.1 Defining the Simulation Domain</h2>
  
<p>Before proceeding to the next steps, the simulation domain must be defined 
and initialized in Sentaurus Interconnect. All the initial regions must be set using 
the already existing tagged coordinates in the grid. In this case, only one region 
is present that you define using the <tt>region</tt> command. The material has been 
chosen to be <tt>silicon</tt>, but other materials in the parameter database can be 
used as well:</p>
  
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - regions" endExpr="##end - regions" excludelines="##*" format="wrap"-->
<pre>
region silicon substrate xlo= top xhi= bottom ylo= left yhi= right zlo= back \
  zhi= front
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>To obtain a complete list of all the materials in the parameter database, use the 
command <tt>mater list.all</tt> on the command line. After the region settings, you must 
initialize the simulation domain with the <tt>init</tt> command:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - init" endExpr="##end - init" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
init !DelayFullD
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->
  
<p>The option <tt>!DelayFullD</tt> is used so that Sentaurus Interconnect considers 
the full 3D space from the beginning. By default, as in Sentaurus Process, the initial 
domain is always 1D until a process step forces the simulator to add a dimension 
(for example, by using a mask). For more details, refer to the Sentaurus Process module, 
<a href="../sp/sp_3.html#2">Section 3.2 Defining the Initial 2D Grid and Simulation Domain</a>, 
or the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Interconnect User Guide</cite>.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<h2>3.2.2 Saving the Initial Model</h2>

<p>The initialized structure can be saved before proceeding to the next steps 
with the <tt>struct</tt> command and the <tt>tdr=&lt;c&gt;</tt> argument:</p>
  
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - struct init" endExpr="##end - struct init" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
struct tdr=n@node@_init
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->
  
<p>In order for the saved file to be available in Sentaurus Workbench for visualization, 
the file name contains the running-node parameter <tt>@node@</tt>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="3"></a>
<h1>3.3 Defining the Elastic Moduli of the Material</h1>

<p>The material properties for silicon are already set in the Sentaurus Interconnect 
database and, in general, there would be no need to define them. If you need to modify 
these properties, use the command <tt>pdbSet</tt> followed by the necessary options.</p>

<p>In this example, the bulk and shear moduli of the chosen material are changed to 
some arbitrary values by setting the Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio equal to 1&nbsp;GPa 
(=10<sup>10</sup> dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) and 0.2, respectively. The conversion to the bulk and shear 
moduli is performed with the built-in Tcl functions <tt>Enu2K</tt> and <tt>Enu2G</tt>:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - materials" endExpr="##end - materials" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
pdbSet Silicon Mechanics BulkModulus [Enu2K 1e10 0.2]
pdbSet Silicon Mechanics ShearModulus [Enu2G 1e10 0.2]
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p class="note">Internally, the Sentaurus Interconnect database always 
uses the units dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> for pressure and cm for lengths.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="4"></a>
<h1>3.4 Setting the Boundary Conditions and Loads for the Solution</h1>

<p>The last important step before the solution is to set all the boundary 
conditions (BCs) and loads. The general command for setting the BCs or loads 
is <tt>stressdata</tt> followed by the <tt>bc.location</tt> and <tt>bc.value</tt> 
arguments:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - BCs" endExpr="##end - BCs" excludelines="##*" format="wrap"-->
<pre>
stressdata bc.location=Bottom bc.value= {dx=0 dy=0 dz=0}
stressdata bc.location=Left bc.value= {sx=0 sy=0 sz=0}
stressdata bc.location=Right bc.value= {sx=0 sy=0 sz=0}
stressdata bc.location=Back bc.value= {sx=0 sy=0 sz=0}
stressdata bc.location=Front bc.value= {sx=0 sy=0 sz=0}
stressdata bc.location=pointend point.coord= {0 0 0} bc.value= {pfx=0 pfy=0 \
  pfz=@p@&lt;dyn&gt;}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The default BC tags assigned to the five uppermost surfaces of the 3D simulation 
domain in Sentaurus Interconnect are <tt>Bottom</tt>, <tt>Left</tt>, <tt>Right</tt>, 
<tt>Back</tt>, and <tt>Front</tt>. There is no &quot;Top&quot; tag for the upper surface.</p>

<p>To constrain the displacements and rotations in the three directions <tt>xyz</tt> 
at the bottom of the cantilever (at <tt>x=50 &mu;m</tt>), set all velocities 
to zero by specifying <tt>bc.location=Bottom</tt> and 
<tt>bc.value= {dx=0 dy=0 dz=0}</tt> (<tt>dx</tt>, <tt>dy</tt>, <tt>dz</tt> are in cm/s 
with the denominator <tt>/dt</tt> being assumed).</p>

<p>The four lateral surfaces (<tt>Left</tt>, <tt>Right</tt>, <tt>Back</tt>, and <tt>Front</tt>) 
of the cantilever should not be constrained with any force or displacement restriction 
and, therefore, zero stresses are applied in all directions with  
<tt>bc.value= {sx=0 sy=0 sz=0}</tt> in the <tt>stressdata</tt> command.</p>

<p>The point force is applied by specifying the coordinates of the application point with 
<tt>point.coord=&nbsp;{0 0 0}</tt> and the orientation and value of the force. 
The latter is done with <tt>bc.value= {pfx=0 pfy=0 pfz=@p@&lt;dyn&gt;}</tt>, 
where <tt>pfx</tt>, <tt>pfy</tt>, and <tt>pfz</tt> are the point forces along the 
x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. During the solution, the nearest mesh node to the 
defined point will be selected to apply the force. The tolerance of this selection 
can be controlled by the following command:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Mechanics Point.Snap.Dist &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

<p>The default value of this tolerance is 1 nm. If you activate the moving mesh option 
in Sentaurus Interconnect, an additional option must be activated to force the application 
point to follow the mesh updates:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetBoolean Mechanics Point.Force.Snap 1
</pre>

<p>In this example, the mesh remains static for simplicity and this does not affect 
the accuracy of the results. During postprocessing, a deformed version of the structure 
can be saved by applying all the calculated displacements to the structure. For more 
information about the moving mesh, refer to the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Interconnect User Guide</cite>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="5"></a>
<h1>3.5 Solving the Problem</h1>

<p>When all the BCs and loads are defined, you continue with the solution 
of the problem. In Sentaurus Interconnect, it is important to specify the 
mode of the simulation as there are many physical domains that can be simulated 
(for example, mechanical, electrical, and thermal) alone or combined. For this 
problem, the mechanical domain is of interest and is set with the <tt>mode</tt> 
command before the <tt>solve</tt> command:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - solution" endExpr="##end - solution" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
mode mechanics
solve 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>With <tt>solve</tt>, the simulator assembles the system matrix and solves the problem 
using the default iterative linear solver (ILS) at the default temperature of 26.85&deg;C. 
More information about the solvers supported in Sentaurus Interconnect can be found in 
the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Interconnect User Guide</cite>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>3.6 Postprocessing the Results</h1>

<p>When the solution is completed, you can inspect the results and extract 
the values of interest. In the case of a mechanics problem, the strains, the 
stresses, and the displacements are of interest. In general, you can visualize 
the entire 3D model with the results mapped on it by saving the structure in TDR format:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - struct final" endExpr="##end - struct final" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
struct tdr=n@node@
struct tdr=n@node@_def deform deform.scale= 5.0
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>As previously mentioned, you can save the deformed structure in a TDR file using the 
<tt>deform</tt> option of the <tt>struct</tt> command. Another argument 
<tt>deform.scale=&lt;n&gt;</tt> can be added if you want to scale the displacement field 
for easier visualization. In this case, a factor of 5 is used for scaling. The TDR files can 
be visualized using Sentaurus Visual.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>, the displacements in the z-direction as well as the strains 
and stresses along the x-axis are shown on the deformed structure. You can clearly see that the 
displacement is highest at the tip of the cantilever where the force is applied, as expected. 
The calculated value for the maximum displacement is approximately equal to 0.58&nbsp;&mu;m, 
very close to the value given by the analytic formula (0.586&nbsp;&mu;m).</p>

<p><a name="Fig3" href="images/si_results.png"><img src="images/si_results.png" width="570" 
alt="Displacements in z-direction, strains in x-direction, and stresses in x-direction" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Visualization of (left) displacements in z-direction shown on deformed 
cantilever, (middle) strains in x-direction on deformed structure, and (right) stresses in x-direction 
mapped onto deformed structure. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>It is also possible to control the visualization from a script by selecting 
the calculated field to be plotted. This is done with the <tt>select</tt> command 
followed by the definition of the field <tt>z=&quot;&lt;field&gt;&quot;</tt>. You can list 
all the calculated fields in the TDR file using the <tt>select</tt> command with the 
option <tt>list.all</tt> on the command line, provided that the TDR file containing the 
result is loaded beforehand with the command <tt>init tdr=&lt;c&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>For the fields that are tensors of rank one or higher (for example, vectors and stresses), 
you can add an underscore and then the index of the tensor element you need as a suffix. 
For example, for the displacement in the x-direction, use 
<tt>z=&quot;Displacement_x&quot;</tt> or, for the stress normal to the yz plane, 
<tt>z=&quot;Stress_xx&quot;</tt> (nodal solution) or <tt>z=&quot;StressEL_xx&quot;</tt> 
(element solution).</p>

<p>With the field of interest selected, you can create a plot of it along a certain 
line, as it is done in this project with the <tt>plot.1d</tt> command:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sinterconnect/3D_Cantilever/sinterconnect_sis.cmd" startExpr="##start - postprocessing" endExpr="##end - postprocessing" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
select z=&quot;Displacement_z&quot;
plot.1d y=0 z=0
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>When the <tt>plot.1d</tt> command is executed, a window displaying the plot opens 
as shown in <a href="#Fig4">Figure&nbsp;4</a>. Remember that if you launch Sentaurus Interconnect 
from Sentaurus Workbench, Sentaurus Interconnect must be set to the <em>interactive</em> mode 
in order for this window to open.</p>

<p>Other options for plotting and saving the results are available using either 
the command line or a script, as well as from Sentaurus Visual. For more 
information about plot commands (for example, <tt>plot.1d</tt>, <tt>plot.2d</tt>), 
refer to the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Interconnect User Guide</cite>.</p>

<a name="7"></a>
<h1>3.7 Using Second-Order Elements</h1>

<p>So far, you have used a relatively dense mesh to obtain enough accuracy in 
the results. The elements used in the previous part are first-order (linear) elements. 
In that case, only the corner nodes of each element contain information on displacements 
and deformation, and the stresses in the element have a constant value.</p>

<p>If second-order (quadratic) elements are used, the centers of all the element edges 
also contain solution information, and the stresses within the element can vary. This 
means that the accuracy of the solution is better when second-order elements are used, 
and this can be achieved with a coarser mesh with respect to a model meshed with 
first-order elements.</p>

<p>To use second-order elements in Sentaurus Interconnect, use the command:</p>

<pre>
pdbSetDouble Mechanics FiniteElementOrder 2
</pre>

<p>It is easy to verify the efficiency of second-order elements in your project. You
can set the Sentaurus Workbench parameter <tt>@res@=3.0</tt>, that is, a 10 times 
larger element size for the mesh, with and without using second-order elements 
(that is, add or remove, respectively, <tt>pdbSetDouble Mechanics FiniteElementOrder 2</tt> 
in the script).</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig5">Figure 5</a>, you can see the significant error in the 
calculated displacements when using first-order elements with such a coarse mesh. In contrast, 
in <a href="#Fig6">Figure 6</a>, the accuracy is unaffected and remains the same as in 
<a href="#Fig4">Figure 4</a> where a 10-times smaller element size was used.</p>

<p>The small cost when using second-order elements is that the execution time is longer 
compared to the solution of the same problem (same mesh density) with first-order elements. 
Sometimes, convergence takes longer to achieve with quadratic elements compared to linear 
elements, but this also depends on the problem to be solved.</p>

<p>There are many problems in which the mesh must be very dense to obtain an accurate 
solution with first-order elements, but they can be very expensive in terms of memory 
usage and execution time. These problems can benefit from using second-order elements 
in terms of both memory and execution time by preserving the same level of accuracy 
as for the fine-meshed models.</p>

<p>In Sentaurus Interconnect, second-order elements can be used with the elasticity 
and plasticity models only.</p>
