<h1>2.1 Introduction</h1>

<p>This section introduces the most common features of EMW in the 
context of a simple 2D silicon&ndash;air structure, where you will 
calculate the optical generation profile in silicon and the reflection. 
The structure is shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>For your convenience, a similar project has been created for the 3D
case. The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench 
in the directory <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple3d</tt>.</p>

<h1>2.2 General Notes on the Command File</h1>

<p>An EMW command file consists of several command sections 
of the form <tt>Section {...}</tt>, with each section describing 
a specific aspect of the simulation. Inside a section, each 
command keyword has the form <tt>keyword = value</tt>, for example:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd"  startExpr="Plot*{*" startOffset=-1 endExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
* Plot the absolute value of the electric field at the end of the simulation
Plot {
  Name      = &quot;n@node@_Eabs&quot;
  Quantity  = {AbsElectricField, AbsMagneticField, Region}
  TickStep  = 300
  StartTick = 100
  EndTick   = 800
  FinalPlot = yes
}                                       
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p class="note">Keywords are case insensitive, but identifiers such as 
region names and materials are surrounded by double quotation marks 
and are case sensitive.<br /><br />

Lists are defined in braces with their items separated by a comma. <br /><br />

Each command must be on a single line; only list items can be wrapped before 
or after the comma.<br /><br />

Comments are indicated by the first character on a line being # or *.</p>

<p>Typically, an EMW command file consists of the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Globals</tt></li> 
<li><tt>ComplexRefractiveIndex</tt></li>
<li><tt>DispersiveMedia</tt></li>
<li><tt>Boundary</tt></li>
<li><tt>PlaneWaveExcitation</tt></li>
<li><tt>Plot</tt></li>
<li><tt>Extractor</tt></li>
<li><tt>Sensor</tt></li>
<li><tt>Monitor</tt></li>
<li><tt>Detector</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the order of the sections in the command file is arbitrary. 
However, it is recommended that you maintain the above order because it 
simplifies navigation looking for a particular parameter. Each command section 
is described in the following sections sequentially, in the context of 
the 2D silicon&ndash;air structure example.</p>

<!--==========================-->
<a name="3"></a>
<h1>2.3 Globals Section</h1>
 
<p>The <tt>Globals</tt> section contains all the global parameter 
settings for the simulation, such as input and output file names, 
which kernel to use, how many threads should be used for the calculation, 
and some limits on the simulation time or the maximum number of time steps.</p>

<p>As a minimal requirement, you must specify 
<tt>GridFile = &quot;myGrid_msh.tdr&quot;</tt> to indicate the tensor 
grid to be used in the EMW simulation.</p>

<p>In addition, typically, the parameter file containing the 
refractive index data and the log file are specified by the 
keywords <tt>ParameterFile</tt> and <tt>LogFile</tt>, respectively. 
A result file (<tt>.plt</tt>) is used when global values must be stored, 
such as the integrated absorbed photon density in a certain volume or the 
photon flux through a surface. As multiple <tt>Plot</tt> sections are allowed, 
the plot file names are defined in the corresponding <tt>Plot</tt> 
sections using the keyword <tt>Name</tt>.</p>

<p>The Courant criteria determine the stable time step for advancing the light 
propagation in FDTD simulations. It links the smallest edge length of the grid 
to the largest possible time step. For dispersive media, so for regions where 
&kappa;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>n</em>, The Courant criteria are not strictly fulfilled. 
Therefore, the simulation might require an even smaller time step as calculated by 
the Courant criteria to converge. To achieve this, the time step can be further 
reduced by a user-specified factor using the keyword <tt>OverSampling</tt>.</p>

<p>FDTD simulations can be very time consuming. Therefore, it is 
a good idea to limit the maximum number of allowed time steps to be 
calculated by <tt>TotalTimeSteps</tt> or the total simulation time 
itself by <tt>TotalSimulationTime</tt> (in seconds).</p>

<p>If you want to save additional disk space, use <tt>CompressTDR=Yes</tt>
to reduce the file size up to a factor of two.</p>

<!--==========================-->
<a name="4"></a>
<h1>2.4 ComplexRefractiveIndex Section</h1>

<p>You can define the optical parameters as a complex refractive index (CRI) 
in the material parameter file. EMW uses the same CRI library as Sentaurus Device. 
Therefore, the same parameter file as for Sentaurus Device can be used. Then, the 
optical data is read from the <tt>ComplexRefractiveIndex</tt> section:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/pp3_msh.par" startExpr="Material*Gas*"  endExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Material = &quot;Gas&quot; { 
  ComplexRefractiveIndex {
    Formula = 0
    n_0 = 1
    k_0 = 0
  }
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The CRI offers different dependencies of the refractive index. The most
commonly used is wavelength dependency. The dependencies can be controlled
materialwise or regionwise by specifying multiple
<tt>ComplexRefractiveIndex</tt> sections with the additional keyword
<tt>Material</tt> or <tt>Region</tt>. In the following example, for the region
<tt>&quot;ambient&quot;</tt>, you use a constant refractive index but, for 
the material <tt>&quot;Silicon&quot;</tt>, you use a wavelength dependency 
for both the refractive index (<tt>Real</tt>) and the extinction coefficient 
(<tt>Imag</tt>):</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="ComplexRefractiveIndex*{*"  endExpr="}*" endOccurrence=2  -->
<pre>
ComplexRefractiveIndex {
  Region = &quot;ambient&quot;
}

ComplexRefractiveIndex {
  Material = &quot;Silicon&quot;
  WavelengthDep = {Real,Imag}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end-->

<p>If neither <tt>Material</tt> nor <tt>Region</tt> is specified, the settings
apply to all regions.</p>

<!--==========================-->
<a name="5"></a>
<h1>2.5 Boundary Section</h1>

<p>For each border of the simulation domain, boundary conditions (BCs) must 
be specified. The border of the domain can be addressed by specifying the 
keyword <tt>Sides</tt> containing a list of <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, <tt>Z</tt>, 
or <tt>Xmin</tt>, <tt>Xmax</tt>, and so on.</p>

<p>In this example, you have an infinite silicon&ndash;air 
interface, so you can use periodic BCs in the horizontal direction. 
In addition, to investigate oblique incident light, you can 
choose the <tt>PeriodicOblique</tt> BC:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Boundary*{*" endExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Boundary {
  Type  = PeriodicOblique
  Sides = {X}
} 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>In the vertical direction (<tt>Sides = {Y}</tt>), you can use absorbing BCs,
where the best damping or absorption is achieved with the convolutional
perfectly matched layer (CPML) by setting <tt>Type = CPML</tt>. EMW provides 
a set of default parameters that are suitable for the most common situations in
semiconductor devices. For more details, see the 
<cite>Sentaurus&trade; Device Electromagnetic Wave Solver User Guide</cite>, 
&quot;Specifying Parameters of CPML Boundary Condition&quot;.</p>

<!--==========================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>2.6 PlaneWaveExcitation Section</h1>

<p>The <tt>PlaneWaveExcitation</tt> section summarizes everything related 
to the plane wave excitation:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="planewaveexcitation*{*"  endExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
PlaneWaveExcitation {
  PlaneY     = -0.5    
  Theta      = 0
  Psi        = 0                                                             
  Wavelength = @&lt;1000.*wavelength&gt;@ * nm
  Intensity  = 0.1  * W/cm2
  Nrise      = 4    * number of signal periods until full power
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end-->

<p>The excitation plane must be axis aligned and cuts through the entire
simulation domain. It is defined by specifying a plane perpendicular to a 
coordinate axis (<tt>PlaneY</tt>) and a coordinate value where the plane 
intersects with the axis (see the red line in Figure&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>The direction of the plane wave &ndash; the k-vector &ndash; is 
defined by the angles <tt>Theta</tt> and <tt>Phi</tt>. A third angle 
<tt>Psi</tt> can be used to define the direction of the E-vector 
or the polarization plane (see Figure&nbsp;2).</p>

<p><a href="images/emw_angles.png"><img src="images/emw_angles.png" width="580" 
alt="Angles for defining 3D excitation" /></a></p>
                                                                
<p class="caption">Figure 2. Angles for defining 3D excitation. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p class="note">In two dimensions, the 3D notation shown in Figure 2 is fully 
supported. However, if only <tt>Theta</tt> is specified and <tt>Phi</tt> is 
omitted, the 2D specification is used, where <tt>Theta</tt> is counted from 
the positive y-axis clockwise (see Figure&nbsp;3). The 2D and 3D angular 
settings can be reviewed in the log file.</p>

<p><a href="images/emw_angles2d.png"><img src="images/emw_angles2d.png" width="580" 
alt="Angle and polarization definitions for 2D excitation" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Angle and polarization definitions for 2D excitation. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>To simplify the setup, EMW can automatically set the position of the excitation 
plane as well as the angles <tt>Theta</tt> and <tt>Phi</tt>, depending on the 
coordinate system orientation and the simulation dimension. This is demonstrated in 
the <tt>simple3d</tt> example:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple3d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="planewaveexcitation*{*"  endExpr="}*" excludeLines="*#*" -->
<pre>
PlaneWaveExcitation {
  Direction  = FromBottom                                                       
  Wavelength = @&lt;1000.*wavelength&gt;@ * nm
  Intensity  = 0.1  * W/cm2
  Nrise      = 4    * number of signal periods until full power
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end-->

<p>The chosen values are printed to the log file:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple3d/n4_eml.out" startExpr="Excitation plane*"  endExpr="Psi*"  -->
<pre>
Excitation plane has been set to 'PlaneZ = -9.6000e-01 [um]' (auto set)

Excitation angles in 3d specification:
Theta = 0.0000e+00 [deg] (auto set)
Phi = 0.0000e+00 [deg] (auto set)
Psi = 45 [deg] (auto set)
</pre>
<!-- grep end-->

<p>Note that you still can change settings on top of this, for example, setting 
<tt>theta=30</tt> to achieve oblique incidence.</p>

<p>The intensity and wavelength of the plane wave are set by specifying 
the <tt>Intensity</tt> in W/cm<sup>2</sup> and <tt>Wavelength</tt> in 
nanometer. Alternatively, the E-field <tt>Amplitude</tt> in V/m and
<tt>Frequency</tt> in Hz can be used.</p>

<p>Finally, for the harmonic signal, the keyword <tt>NRise</tt> specifies the
number of signal periods before the full amplitude is reached. This is an
important keyword to achieve good convergence. Too small a value introduces
artificial higher frequencies (think of a step function whose Fourier
transformation consists of a very broad spectrum), which must vanish before
steady state is reached and, eventually, prevent the system from converging. On
the other hand, too high a value increases simulation time, because a larger
rise time results in a longer total calculation time. Typical values are between
4 and 15 in practice.</p>

<!--===============================================-->
<a name="7"></a>
<h1>2.7 Plot Section</h1>

<p>The <tt>Plot</tt> section controls the plotting of time-dependent quantities
such as the E-field and H-field, or the Poynting vector:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Plot*{*"  endexpr="}*" excludeLines="*#*" -->
<pre>
Plot {
  Name      = &quot;n@node@_Eabs&quot;
  Quantity  = {AbsElectricField, AbsMagneticField, Region}
  TickStep  = 300
  StartTick = 100
  EndTick   = 800
  FinalPlot = yes
}                                       
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>As multiple <tt>Plot</tt> sections are allowed in the command file, each
<tt>Plot</tt> section has a name, which is used as the file name for the plot
file, for example, <tt>Name = &quot;n1_Eabs&quot;</tt> generates a plot file
<tt>n1_Eabs_eml.tdr</tt>.</p>

<p>The quantities that will be included in the plot can be selected with
<tt>Quantity&nbsp;=&nbsp;{&lt;identifier&gt;,&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</tt>. In the above
example, the electric and magnetic field magnitudes are plotted. The quantity
<tt>Region</tt> stores the region boundaries and their names in the plot file
for better orientation during visualization.</p>

<p>When the plot is to be created, it can be controlled with the keywords
<tt>StartTick</tt>, <tt>EndTick</tt>, and <tt>TickStep</tt>. In the example, a
plot is generated starting at the 100th time step, then every 300 time steps
until the 800th time step is reached, that is, at 100, 400, 700. The created
plot files have an index appended to the file name
(<tt>n1_Eabs_eml_000.tdr</tt>).</p>

<p>If <tt>FinalPlot = yes</tt> is specified, a plot file will be
created at the end of the simulation.</p>

<p>In summary, the above <tt>Plot</tt> section generates several plot files with
the names <tt>n4_Eabs_eml_000.tdr</tt>, <tt>n4_Eabs_eml_001.tdr</tt>, and
<tt>n4_Eabs_eml_002.tdr</tt> as well as the final plot file
<tt>n4_Eabs_eml.tdr</tt>. The plot files can be viewed with Sentaurus Visual
(see the <a href="../sv/sv_menu.html">Sentaurus Visual module</a>).</p>

<!--==============================-->
<a name="7_3d"></a>
<h2>2.7.1 Notes on 3D Plotting</h2>

<p>As EMW tensor grids can have hundreds of millions of vertices, the plotting 
can require substantial time. Therefore, you have the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restrict the plot domain.</li>
<li>Interpolate results to a coarser mixed-element grid.</li>
<li>Define axis-aligned cuts.</li>
</ul>

<p>To restrict the plot domain, a user-defined box or region can be defined to 
reduce the amount of stored data. The box is defined by specifying two opposite 
corners of a rectangle using <tt>BoxCorner1</tt> and <tt>BoxCorner2</tt>. For 
convenience, the minimum and maximum coordinate values of the domain boundaries 
can be retrieved with the keywords <tt>min</tt> and <tt>max</tt>. For example:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Plot*{*"  startOccurrence=2 endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Plot {
  Name       = &quot;n@node@_Si&quot;
  BoxCorner1 = {min,   0, 0}
  BoxCorner2 = {max, max, 0}
  Quantity   = {AbsElectricField, Region}
}                                       
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>In three dimensions, you can specify axis aligned cuts by using on of the keywords 
<tt>PlaneX</tt>, <tt>PlaneY</tt>, <tt>PlaneZ</tt>.</p>

<p>The following <tt>Plot</tt> section, for example, generates an x-cut of the 
electric field at x = 0.05 and saves it to a file <tt>n4_xcut_eml.tdr</tt>:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple3d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Plot*{*" endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Plot {                                          
  Name      = &quot;n@node@_Ex&quot;
  Quantity  = {AbsElectricField, Region}
  PlaneX    = 0.05    
  FinalPlot = yes
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Another possibility to reduce the amount of stored data is to plot the result 
variables on a coarser mixed-element grid, instead of the very dense tensor grid. 
This can be activated by providing a mixed-element grid file with <tt>GridFile</tt> 
in the <tt>Plot</tt> section. An example is provided in 
<a href="emw_3.html">Section&nbsp;3. Integrating EMW in Sentaurus Workbench Tool Flow</a>.</p>

<!--=================================-->
<a name="8"></a>
<h1>2.8 Extractor Section</h1>

<p>The <tt>Extractor</tt> section, very similar to plots, extracts spatial device 
quantities and writes it to a TDR file. However, the main difference is that extractors 
extract quantities that require heavy postprocessing, for example, time-averaged quantities 
such as the time-averaged <tt>PowerFluxDensity</tt>, <tt>AbsorbedPhotonDensity</tt>, and 
<tt>OpticalGeneration</tt>. Like plots, the output can be restricted to certain regions 
or boxes, it can be evaluated for axis-aligned cuts only, and it can be written on 
a coarse mixed-element grid instead of a tensor grid.</p>

<p>The most important quantity, the optical generation, is covered by 
<tt>AbsorbedPhotonDensity</tt>. In the following example, the absorbed photon 
density profile in the silicon can be computed using the syntax:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Extractor*{*"  endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Extractor {
  Name     = &quot;n@node@_g&quot;
  Quantity = {AbsorbedPhotonDensity, Region}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The result is stored in the <tt>n4_g_eml.tdr</tt> file and can be viewed 
in a similar way to the plot files in Sentaurus Visual.</p>

<p class="note">Do not extract too large 3D tensor grids as this might consume 
considerable amounts of time. Instead, use cuts or interpolate to a mixed-element 
grid. See <a href="#7_3d">Section&nbsp;2.7.1 Notes on 3D Plotting</a>.</p>

<!--==========================-->
<a name="9"></a>
<h1>2.9 Sensor Section</h1>

<p>Sensors provide users with the ability to measure integrated values of the
photon flux through user-defined areas or the absorbed photon density in
selected volumes. The result is a scalar value and is written to the result
file. Similar to the excitation, planes can be defined with <tt>PlaneY</tt>.
Integration volumes can be defined with <tt>BoxCorner1</tt> and
<tt>BoxCorner2</tt> in analogy to the <tt>Plot</tt> section. In addition, a
region (or material) of the tensor grid, which does not necessarily need to be
cuboid, can be used as the identifier for volume integration.</p>

<p class="note">The region (or material) definition requires more runtime. So 
wherever possible, use boxes as the integration regions.</p>

<p>As multiple sensors are allowed, sensors must be named with the keyword 
<tt>Name</tt>. The quantity to be measured is set with <tt>Quantity</tt>. 
The sensor returns the integrated value, or the averaged value, or both 
(for example, <tt>Mode = {Integrate, Average}</tt>).</p>

<p class="note">For 2D simulations, the third dimension is assumed to be 1
&mu;m.</p>

<p>The following lines from the <tt>simple2d</tt> example demonstrate how to
calculate the reflection of the structure. Therefore, the sensor is defined
above the excitation plane at the upper boundary in the scattered field region
(see Figure 1):</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="*Name*reflected*" startOffset=-1   endExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Sensor {
  Name       = &quot;reflected&quot;
  Quantity   = PhotonFluxDensity 
  PlaneY     = min
  Mode       = {Integrate}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>This returns the number of reflected photons per second. However, 
usually, you are interested in the reflection coefficient, so you must 
divide the number of reflected photons by the number of incident photons.</p>

<p>As the number of incident photons is not directly accessible as in 
the total-field scattered-field excitation, you only have (Total Field 
= Incident + Reflected) and (Scattered Field = Reflected). 
However, knowing the total flux, you can subtract the scattered flux 
to extract the incident flux. For this, you can define a sensor solely 
between the excitation plane and the silicon surface to measure the 
total flux (see Figure 1):</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="*Name*total*" startOffset=-1 EndExpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Sensor {
  Name       = &quot;total&quot;
  Quantity   = PhotonFluxDensity 
  PlaneY     = -0.2
  Mode       = {Integrate}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The results are accessible in the log file and the result file
(<tt>.plt</tt>), and can be viewed and further processed in Sentaurus
Visual.</p>

<p>To compute the transmission coefficient, you can add, in a 
similar way as for the reflection, an additional sensor at 
the bottom of the silicon (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>To calculate the absorption, you can define a sensor that encloses the entire
silicon region, but this time, integrating the absorbed photon density:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="*Name*absorbed*" startOffset=-1 endExpr="}*"-->
<pre>
Sensor {
  Name     = &quot;absorbed&quot;
  Quantity = AbsorbedPhotonDensity
  BoxCorner1 = {min, min, 0}
  BoxCorner2 = {max, max, 0}
  Mode     = {Integrate}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>For volume integration, it is also possible to define box corners and a
region at the same time. In that case, the keyword <tt>Domains</tt> defines how
the integration volumes will be connected. They can be evaluated as
<tt>United</tt>, or <tt>Intersecting</tt>, or <tt>Separate</tt>.</p>

<p>The following <tt>Sensor</tt> section in example <tt>simple2d</tt> performs
the integration in the substrate region, but only if it is inside a rectangle of
(<tt>min,min</tt>)&ndash;(<tt>0.05,max</tt>), where <tt>min</tt> and
<tt>max</tt> refer to the domain boundaries:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="*Name*intersected*" startOffset=-1 endExpr="}*" -->

<p>As it is very common to calculate reflection, transmission, and absorption 
(RTA) in an EMW simulation, EMW offers a shortcut for setting up the required 
sensors for RTA and total field, and for performing the postprocessing. 
Specifying the command section <tt>RTA {}</tt> will automatically add the previously 
mentioned sensors, calculate RTA and the sum of it (RTA=R+T+A), and output the 
results to the EMW log as DoE result parameters, so Sentaurus Workbench can pick 
them up for its table of simulation results. In addition, the results are written 
to the result file. See the <tt>simple3d</tt> example.</p>

<p>You can further fine-tune the RTA calculation, for example, specifying which 
results to plot to the Sentaurus Workbench table, by using the keyword <tt>Log</tt>. 
For example, the following section plots only <tt>R</tt>, <tt>T</tt>, and <tt>A</tt>, 
and their sum (<tt>RTA</tt>).</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple3d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="RTA*{*"  endexpr="}*" excludeLines="*Tick*" -->
<pre>
RTA {
  Log = {R,T,A,RTA}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p class="note">The <tt>RTA</tt> section requires the <tt>Direction</tt> keyword 
to be specified in the <tt>PlaneWaveExcitation</tt> section, to decide on which 
boundary to place the reflection and tranmission sensors.</p>

<p>Like the <tt>Plot</tt> section, <tt>Sensor</tt> sections and the <tt>RTA</tt> 
section can be evaluated not only at the end, but also during time-stepping. 
Therefore, you can observe the transient evolution of the sensor values, for 
example, to investigate convergence.</p>

<p>To activate transient evaluation, specify <tt>StartTick</tt> and optionally 
<tt>TickStep</tt>:</p>
 
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple3d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="RTA*{*"  endexpr="}*" excludeLines="*Log*" -->
<pre>
RTA {
  StartTick = 0
}
</pre>

<h1>2.10 Detector Section</h1>

<p>The purpose of the detector is to terminate the simulation if 
the simulation fulfills certain criteria. For harmonic excitation, 
the simulation terminates if a time-harmonic steady-state is reached, 
that is, if the maximum deviation of the field compared to the field in the 
immediately preceding period is lower than the specified <tt>Tolerance</tt>.</p>

<p>In this case, you can set the evaluation region of the detector for 
the entire simulation domain, with <tt>Tolerance</tt> set to 1e-3:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Detector*{*"  endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Detector {
  Tolerance = 1e-3
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>During an EMW simulation, the <tt>Detector</tt> section writes the maximum
deviation of the entire <tt>Detector</tt> domain to the log file and to the result 
file. Sometimes, it can be useful to monitor the convergence behavior
visually to have a better understanding of the current state of the simulation
and to decide whether an increased number of time steps would significantly
reduce the maximum deviation and, therefore, lead to more accurate results.</p>

<p>The maximum deviation can be plotted over time or over the number of time
steps (denoted as <tt>TickStep</tt>). The data is saved continuously in the
<tt>ResultFile</tt> specified in the <tt>Globals</tt> section of the command
file and can be plotted in Sentaurus Visual. Clicking the <strong>Reload</strong> 
button in Sentaurus Visual during an EMW simulation adds any new data points computed 
in the intervening time to the existing curve and updates the plot accordingly.</p>

<p>An example of how to plot maximum deviation versus time steps can be
investigated from within the project 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d</tt> in the 
<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d/svisual_vis.tcl">
svisual_vis.tcl</a> command file.</p>

<p>In this example, the convergence monitoring plot is generated by selecting
the Sentaurus Visual node and then clicking the <strong>Run Selected Visualizer
Nodes Together</strong> toolbar button of Sentaurus Workbench. To refresh the plot
with new data points, choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Reload All</strong>, 
or choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Reload Selected</strong>, in 
Sentaurus Visual.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows a plot of the maximum deviation versus time steps for
<tt>tolerance=0.001</tt> in the <tt>Detector</tt> section.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. Convergence monitoring. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>In addition to the maximum deviation, you can plot the transient evolution 
of sensors, like R, T, and A as demonstrated in the example project <tt>simple3d</tt>. 
Figure&nbsp;5 shows the maximum deviation and tolerance as before, but in addition, 
on the right axis, R, T, and A. See how reflection converges quite fast as the 
light just needs to travel to the Si&ndash;air interface and back. There is no 
further reflecting in this device. For the transmission (and absorption), it takes 
a bit longer, as the wave front has to reach the rear side of the silicon.</p>

<p><a href="images/emw_rta_transient.png"><img src="images/emw_rta_transient.png" width="570" 
alt="Transient evolution of R, T, A" /></a></p>
                                                                
<p class="caption">Figure 5. Transient evolution of R, T, and A. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>In addition, the quantity <tt>1 &ndash; (R+T+A)</tt> (labeled as <tt>1-RTA</tt>) 
is plotted on the left axis. This quantity is a measure for the overall accuracy of 
your simulation and ideally equals 0. It is mainly influenced by the mesh and when 
the simulation is stopped. So, if the value unsatisfactorily deviates from 0, it 
is an indication to use a finer mesh or to run the simulation for a longer time, 
which reduces the tolerance of the detector.</p>

<h1>2.11 Postprocessing</h1>

<p>FDTD simulations are usually very time consuming and produce huge amounts of
data, which are difficult to handle afterwards. Imagine you ran a FDTD simulation for
a few hours and, at the end, you realize that you would like to investigate
the E-field in an additional cut or to use an additional sensor to integrate the
absorbed photon density for a different region.</p>

<p>In this case, the postprocessing capability of EMW can be very helpful because 
it allows you to save the absorbed photon density and power flux density together 
with the region information at the end of a FDTD simulation in a save file. After 
the simulation, this save file can be loaded into EMW, applying arbitrary extractors 
and sensors to it without having to redo the calculation.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the principle of postprocessing, the <tt>simple2d</tt> project
described above is chosen and split into two EMW tool instances:</p>

<p>The first tool instance <tt>emw</tt> performs the FDTD calculation, without 
applying any extractor or sensor. It simply saves the results in a save file by 
specifying a <tt>Save</tt> section:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d-postprocess/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Save*{*"  endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Save {
  Name = &quot;@save@&quot;
  Quantity = {AbsorbedPhotonDensity, PowerFluxDensity}
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The save file name is specified with the Sentaurus Workbench file reference <tt>@save@</tt>, 
which expands to <tt>n4_save_eml.tdr</tt>.</p>

<p>A silver region has been added to one end of the silicon and is explicitly treated 
as a dispersive medium:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d-postprocess/emw_eml.cmd" startExpr="Dispersive*{*"  endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
DispersiveMedia {
  Material = {&quot;Silver&quot;}
  Model = SingleDipoleDrude
  ModelParameters = ComputeFromComplexRefractiveIndex
  InterfaceAveraging = yes
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The <tt>SingleDipoleDrude</tt> model used here computes a single-pole fitting
for silver at the defined excitation wavelength. The wavelength-dependent <i>n
&amp; k</i> values are read directly from the <tt>NumericalTable</tt> in the
<tt>ComplexRefractiveIndex</tt> section of the material parameter file by
specifying <tt>ModelParameters = ComputeFromComplexRefractiveIndex</tt>. With
<tt> InterfaceAveraging = yes</tt>, a weighted average of the dielectric
function in the frequency domain is used at the silicon&ndash;silver interface, 
which helps to improve convergence and accuracy during runtime and is typically
recommended when using dispersive models.</p>

<p>Click to view the command file 
<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d-postprocess/emw_eml.cmd">
emw_eml.cmd</a>.</p>

<p>The second tool instance <tt>emwPostProcess</tt> loads the save file by
specifying <tt>LoadFile</tt> in the <tt>Globals</tt> section:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/emw/simple2d-postprocess/emwPostProcess_eml.cmd" startExpr="Global*{*"  endexpr="}*" -->
<pre>
Globals {
  LoadFile    = &quot;@load@&quot;
  ResultFile  = &quot;@plot@&quot;
  LogFile     = &quot;@log@&quot;
}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Again, a Sentaurus Workbench file reference is used to specify the file name;
<tt>@load@</tt> expands to <tt>n4_save_eml.tdr</tt>. Subsequently, any
<tt>Extractor</tt> or <tt>Sensor</tt> sections are evaluated as for a standard
EMW simulation.</p>

<p class="note">For postprocessing, apart from the <tt>Globals</tt> section,
only <tt>Extractor</tt> and <tt>Sensor</tt> sections are allowed.</p>

<p>In this particular example, the absorbed photon density is extracted and
sensors are placed as for the <tt>simple2d</tt> project to extract reflection,
transmission, and absorption.</p>
