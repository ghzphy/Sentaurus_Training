<h1>8.1 Overview</h1>

<p>This section is dedicated to the extraction of crucial information (also called 
<em>metrology</em> in the text) from Sentaurus Topography 3D PMC simulations. This 
information can be extracted during the PMC simulation runtime or as postprocessing 
steps after the simulation is finished.</p>

<p>You can use Sentaurus Visual for visualization and further processing of the 
extracted data. A Sentaurus Workbench project (see Figure&nbsp;1) is available with 
a complete example of an ion-assisted etch simulation (the same as in 
<a href="./stopo_6.html#3">Section&nbsp;6.3 Example: PMC Ion-Assisted Etching</a>) and 
the associated metrology steps along with the Sentaurus Visual tool instances to facilitate 
visualization.</p>

<p>The first Sentaurus Topography 3D tool instance performs an ion-assisted etch 
(as in <a href="./stopo_6.html#3">Section&nbsp;6.3 Example: PMC Ion-Assisted Etching</a>) 
and executes the runtime extractions to obtain critical PMC data. The second Sentaurus 
Topography 3D tool instance reads the <tt>.pmc</tt> restart file saved in the first 
tool instance and performs the shape analysis extraction to obtain the geometric 
characteristics of the etched feature.</p>

<p>Three Sentaurus Visual tool instances are included in the project to demonstrate 
how to load and visualize the CSV and TDR files generated in the first two Sentaurus 
Topography 3D  tool instances. Comments are added to help you distinguish the functionality 
of each tool.</p>

<p>The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench in the 
directory <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/PMC_Metrology</tt>.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Sentaurus Workbench projects, then the preprocessed 
script files <tt>pp_pmc_ion_assisted_etch_t3d.cmd</tt> and 
<tt>pp_post_process_extraction_t3d.cmd</tt> can be found in this directory.</p>

<h1>8.2 Create Extraction Boxes for Runtime PMC Data</h1>

<p>You can extract information about the simulated structures during runtime by 
using the command <tt>define_extraction</tt>. This information covers the geometric 
characteristics of the simulated structure such as dimensions, material thicknesses 
(see also the example in <a href="./stopo_6.html#3">
Section&nbsp;6.3 Example: PMC Ion-Assisted Etching</a>), areas, volumes, feature 
profiles as well as the events occurring on the surface, for example, the impact 
of gas species, the reactions, or the reemission of particles.</p>

<p>In PMC simulations, you can select specific parts of the simulation domain 
using bounding boxes in order to extract the PMC data for the reactions occurring 
in the part of the PMC simulation domain contained within the boxes. It is also 
possible to perform an extraction on an axis-aligned 2D plane (normal to the x-, 
y-, or z-axis) by specifying the keywords <tt>axis</tt> and <tt>position</tt> in 
the command <tt>define_extraction</tt>. For example:</p>

<pre>
define_extraction type=pmc_data name=pmc_stats \
  quantities= {reaction_executions sputtered_volume sputter_yield} \
  axis=x position=0.1 reactions= {R1 R2 R3} \
  csv_file= pmc_data_box_2D_cut.csv
</pre>

<p>The extraction can be executed at user-defined time intervals during the PMC 
simulation defined with the keyword <tt>extraction_interval</tt> in the command 
<tt>etch</tt>. Multiple extraction boxes can be defined and grouped under the same 
name using the command <tt>define_extrusion</tt> and the keyword <tt>name</tt>.</p> 

<p>Various quantities regarding the gas species, the surface reactions, and their 
products can be included in the extracted data:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>deposited_volume</tt>: Volume of deposited species</li>
<li><tt>reaction_executions</tt>: Number of reaction executions</li>
<li><tt>species_volume</tt>: Total species volume in the PMC simulation domain</li>
<li><tt>sputter_yield</tt>: Effective sputter yield for various gas species and 
surface materials (for the reactions to which this applies, that is, sputtering reactions)</li>
<li><tt>sputtered_volume</tt>: Total volume of sputtered species</li>
<li><tt>volumetric_source_particles</tt>: Density of emission points of volumetric source species 
in the extraction box</li>
</ul>

<p>For models with many surface reactions, only a small set of reactions might 
be of interest, and they can be defined using a list with the keyword 
<tt>reactions</tt> or by specifying reaction name patterns with glob syntax by using 
the keyword <tt>expression_pattern</tt>. For example:</p>

<pre>expression_pattern=&quot;*SiFx*&quot;</pre>

<p>The results of the PMC data extraction can be saved in a comma-separated file 
(with the <tt>.csv</tt> file extension) and visualized in Sentaurus Visual or in a 
spreadsheet application. In the Sentaurus Workbench project <tt>PMC_Metrology</tt>, 
two extraction boxes are defined (see Figure&nbsp;2) with a <tt>for</tt> loop. 
The first extraction box covers the lower half of the structure and the second 
extraction box covers the upper half of the structure. In addition, an extraction 
definition on a 2D plane is added in the same group named <tt>pmc_stats</tt>.</p>

width="240" alt="Extraction boxes in structure" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. Extraction boxes location in the structure: Box 1

<p>The commands for the defined extractions are given here:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/PMC_Metrology/pmc_ion_assisted_etch_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - Data Analysis Boxes" endExpr="##end - Data Analysis Boxes" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
set number_of_boxes 2
for {set i 1} {$i &lt;= $number_of_boxes} {incr i} {
    set step [expr $bbox_z_length/$number_of_boxes]

    ## Define extraction for PMC reactions' statistics for box No. $i 
    define_extraction type=pmc_data name=pmc_stats \
       quantities= $quantities  \
       reactions= {sput_Si refl_Si sput_SiFx refl_SiFx adsorb_F_Si etch_F_Si} \
       csv_file=n@node@_pmc_stats_box_${i}.csv \
       point_min= &quot;$bbox_xmin $bbox_ymin [expr $bbox_zmin+($i-1)*$step]&quot; \
       point_max= &quot;$bbox_xmax $bbox_ymax [expr $bbox_zmin+($i)*$step]&quot;
}

define_extraction type=pmc_data name=pmc_stats \
   quantities= $quantities axis=x position=[lindex $bbox_xmin 0] \
   reactions= {sput_Si refl_Si sput_SiFx refl_SiFx adsorb_F_Si etch_F_Si} \
   csv_file=n@node@_pmc_stats_box_2D_cut.csv 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The results of the extractions are saved in the files named 
<tt>n@node@_pmc_stats_box_1.csv</tt> (for Box&nbsp;1), <tt>csv_file=n@node@_pmc_stats_box_2.csv</tt> 
(for Box&nbsp;2), and <tt>n@node@_pmc_stats_box_2D_cut.csv</tt> (for 2D cutplane). 
At every defined time interval with the keyword <tt>extraction_interval</tt> in the <tt>etch</tt> 
command, the extracted data is appended to those files as in the following example:</p>
 
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/PMC_Metrology/pmc_ion_assisted_etch_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - run pmc" endExpr="##end - run pmc" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
etch machine=rie_machine spacing=0.002 time=1000.0&lt;s&gt; method=pmc \
   extraction=pmc_stats extraction_interval= 250.0&lt;s&gt;\
   plot_type={surface} plot_interval=250.0&lt;s&gt; file=n@node@_surface.tdr
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The extracted data can be visualized with Sentaurus Visual as demonstrated in the 
<tt>svisual1</tt> tool instance as shown in Figure&nbsp;3.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Screen capture of Sentaurus Visual showing the 
available data stored in the .csv files extracted at runtime of the ion-assisted 
etch PMC simulation. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>In Figure 3, the reaction executions for the sputtering reaction of SiFx are plotted 
as a function of time. In the upper part of the structure, only the photoresist mask is 
present, so there is no silicon or SiFx species and the executions are zero (green line). 
In the lower part (red line &ndash; Box 1) of the structure, sputtering is increased when 
Ar<sup>+</sup> ions are introduced (see Figure 5 in <a href="./stopo_6.html#3_timedep_distr">
Section&nbsp;6.3.1 PMC Time-Dependent Species Distributions</a>). The number of executions 
flattens out when the flux of XeF<sub>2</sub> is switched off and only the remaining 
SiFx is sputtered from the surface by Ar<sup>+</sup> ions without any new SiFx being 
created.</p>

<p>More data about the reaction executions from the ion-assisted etching model can be 
visualized as a function of time as shown in Figure&nbsp;3.</p>

<h1>8.3 Runtime Extraction of Surface-Mapped PMC Information</h1>

<p>In addition to the extraction of volume-averaged PMC data with boxes or 2D planes, 
you can extract PMC information mapped on to the exposed surface at user-defined intervals 
or specific time points during the simulation. You can do so by using the keywords 
<tt>plot_interval</tt> (or <tt>plot_times</tt> for a list of specific times) and 
<tt>plot_type</tt>.</p>

<p>The following supported plot types for PMC simulations are saved in a TDR file defined by 
the <tt>file</tt> parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>gc</tt>: GC type of TDR file.</li>
<li><tt>surface</tt>: TDR file of the exposed surface at each time interval on which 
PMC information is mapped (reactions, fluxes, reemissions, reflections, and so on). 
The extracted surfaces are appended in the same TDR file (defined by the parameter 
<tt>file</tt> in the <tt>etch</tt> command) at each time interval.</li>
<li><tt>vbe</tt>: Boundary representation saved in the TDR file directly extracted 
from the PMC domain.</li>
<li><tt>volume_fractions</tt>: Grid-based species volume fractions saved in the TDR file.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a surface plot saved during ion-assisted etching is given in the 
Sentaurus Workbench project <tt>PMC_Metrology</tt>, and it is visualized with the 
Sentaurus Visual tool instance named <tt>svisual2</tt> (see Figure&nbsp;4). The 
definition of <tt>plot_intervals</tt> is performed directly in the <tt>etch</tt> 
command:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/PMC_Metrology/pmc_ion_assisted_etch_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - run pmc" endExpr="##end - run pmc" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
etch machine=rie_machine spacing=0.002 time=1000.0&lt;s&gt; method=pmc \
   extraction=pmc_stats extraction_interval= 250.0&lt;s&gt;\
   plot_type={surface} plot_interval=250.0&lt;s&gt; file=n@node@_surface.tdr
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

width="570" alt="Surface plot of the flux ratio of Ar+/XeF2 species" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. Surface mapping of flux ratio Ar<sup>+</sup>/XeF<sub>2</sub>. 
In the beginning of the process, the Ar<sup>+</sup> flux is zero. Later both fluxes, 
Ar<sup>+</sup> and XeF<sub>2</sub>, are switched on and the ratio increases on the 
horizontal surfaces but is much less on the sidewalls due to the high directionality 
of the Ar<sup>+</sup> ions. At the end of the etching cycle, the flux of XeF<sub>2</sub> 
is switched off and the flux ratio Ar<sup>+</sup>/XeF<sub>2</sub> takes its maximum value 
on all surfaces. Many other fields are available for visualization as shown on the left 
side of the Sentaurus Visual window. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<h1>8.4 Postprocess Shape Analysis Extractions</h1>

<p>The Sentaurus Topography 3D tool instance labeled <tt>post_process_extraction</tt> 
loads the PMC restart file from the previous Sentaurus Topography 3D  tool instance 
and performs a shape analysis of the etched feature in the structure.</p>

<p>To load the PMC restart file, specify the <tt>define_structure</tt> command with 
the parameter <tt>pmc_file</tt> as follows:</p>

<pre>
define_structure pmc_file=n@node|pmc_ion_assisted_etch@_result.pmc
</pre>

<p>The PMC file can only be used to restart the PMC simulation from the point at 
which it stopped in the previous step after the ion-assisted etching (it cannot 
be visualized with Sentaurus Visual). After the state of the PMC simulation is 
reestablished after loading the PMC file, it is possible to continue with another PMC 
simulation step or to use the <tt>extract</tt> command to extract metrology information. 
Here, the <tt>extract</tt> command is used as a postprocessing step to perform a shape 
analysis of the structure, which is a cylindrical hole etched in silicon. The command 
syntax is the following:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/PMC_Metrology/post_process_extraction_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - Shape Analysis" endExpr="##end - Shape Analysis" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
extract name=shape_analysis  type=shape_analysis \
   reference_shape=cylinder_hole max_radius=0.03 \
   point1=&quot;$bbox_middle_x $bbox_middle_y $bbox_zmin&quot; \
   point2=&quot;$bbox_middle_x $bbox_middle_y $bbox_zmax&quot; \
   csv_file=n@node@_shape_analysis.csv output_type={doe csv} smoothing_order=0
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Two reference shapes can be used depending on the feature geometry: either 
<tt>cylinder_hole</tt> for structures with cylindrical symmetry or <tt>trench</tt> 
for structures that have a groove-like shape as a trench. The cylindrical bounding 
box is specified by two points (<tt>point1</tt> and <tt>point2</tt>) that define 
the bottom and top of the vertical cylinder axis, and by the radius 
(<tt>max_radius</tt>) of the cylinder (see Figure&nbsp;5).</p>

alt="Cylindrical hole shape analysis" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 5. Definition of extraction window for shape analysis when 
<tt>reference_shape=cylinder_hole</tt>. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The extracted metrics from the shape analysis can be saved in a CSV file (defined 
with the parameter <tt>csv_file</tt>), in a TDR file (defined with the parameter 
<tt>tdr_file</tt>), and also as Sentaurus Workbench variables by setting 
<tt>output_type={ csv tdr doe }</tt>. The <tt>doe</tt> option generates the variables 
that are shown automatically at the end of the extraction in the Sentaurus Workbench 
project (see Figure&nbsp;6).</p>

<p>See the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Topography 3D User Guide</cite>, Shape Analysis, 
for detailed explanations of these variables in the tables in that section.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. Shape analysis extracted metrics exported as Sentaurus 
Workbench variables. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The CSV or TDR files containing the shape analysis information can be loaded 
in Sentaurus Visual to plot the extracted metrics as a function of depth Z as shown 
in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The same type of plot is generated by running the node of 
the Sentaurus Visual labeled <tt>svisual3</tt> in the project <tt>PMC_Metrology</tt>.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 7. Plot generated by svisual3 Sentaurus Visual tool 
instance showing the average surface coverage of species SiFx as a function of 
depth in the cylindrical hole. The values are zero on the sidewalls of the photoresist 
mask for Z &gt; 0 and for Z &lt; -0.07 &mu;m in bulk silicon. SiFx coverage on the 
sidewalls drops with depth as fluorine species have a higher probability (high 
reactivity) of reacting with silicon at the upper part of the hole and is also very low 
at the bottom where SiFx is heavily sputtered by Ar<sup>+</sup> ions. A similar plot 
can be created by using the average radius of the hole, which will correspond to the 
hole profile (Figure&nbsp;8). (Click image for full-size view.)</p>
