<h1>5.1 Introduction to the Particle Monte Carlo Engine</h1>

<p>The PMC engine for feature-scale simulation of etching and deposition processes 
is based on a cellular grid representation of the wafer structure, and a PMC technique 
to model the fluxes of plasma-generated species to the wafer surface. Simulations with 
the PMC engine are always run in three dimensions. For the same model and similar 
accuracy, the PMC engine is, in general, significantly faster than the level-set engine, 
up to factors of 100 and more.</p>

<p>In contrast to the level-set engine, which calculates etching and deposition rates 
on the gas&ndash;material interface (as shown in 
<a href="stopo_4.html">Section&nbsp;4. Working With the Rate Formula Module</a>) and 
then advances this interface accordingly, the PMC engine relies on a set of user-specified 
surface reactions that control the interactions of plasma-generated species with the 
exposed part of the wafer representation.</p>

<p>This modeling approach is natural, versatile, and simple, because each surface reaction 
describes only one elementary interaction of the plasma-generated species with one of 
the species on the wafer surface.</p>

<h2>5.1.1 Main Parts of a PMC Process Step</h2>

<p>A PMC process step is divided into four main steps that must be specified in the correct 
order in the Tcl command file to be executed by Sentaurus Topography 3D:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the PMC model (see <a href="#2">Section 5.2 Defining the PMC Model</a>).</li>
<li>Define the source species characteristics (see 
<a href="#3">Section 5.3 Defining the Source Species Characteristics</a>).</li>
<li>Define the PMC machine (see <a href="#4">Section 5.4 Defining the PMC Machine</a>).</li>
<li>Define the PMC model reaction properties (see 
<a href="#5">Section 5.5 Defining the PMC Model Reaction Properties</a>).</li>
</ol>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="2"></a>
<h1>5.2 Defining the PMC Model</h1>

<p>In PMC, instead of using an analytic formula for the etching or deposition rate 
(as in the rate formula module (RFM)), a set of reactions is used to model the 
interaction of the incoming species in the gas phase (tag <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> is used 
from now on) with the materials on the surface (tagged with <tt>&lt;s&gt;</tt> from now on). 
As for RFM models, the definition of a new reaction model starts with the 
<tt>define_model</tt> command and ends with the <tt>finalize_model</tt> command.</p>

<!--==============================-->
<a name="source_species"></a>
<h2>5.2.1 Defining the Source Species</h2>

<p>Before writing the reactions, you must define all the incoming species in the 
gas phase that will be used in the PMC reaction model. There is no limitation to 
the names or the number of the species to be used. Of course, you cannot define 
two separate gas species with the same name.</p>

<p>Unlike the definition of a level set&ndash;based model, there is no distinction 
between ion and neutral species when the source species are defined in the model. 
The properties of the gas species (flux, and angular and energy distributions) are 
defined after the model definition, so the same model can be used with different 
gas species properties, if needed.</p>

<p>To define a new gas species (for example, fluorine (F)) in a PMC model, you use 
the <tt>add_source_species</tt> command after the <tt>define_model</tt> command as 
follows:</p>

<pre>
define_model name=PMCModel1 description=&quot;Simple Etch Model&quot;

add_source_species name=F model=PMCModel1
...

finalize_model model=PMCModel1
</pre>

<!--==============================-->
<a name="surface_reactions"></a>
<h2>5.2.2 Defining the Surface Reactions</h2>

<p>After all the gas species are defined, the next step is to define the surface 
reactions of the model, that is, all the reactions needed between the gas species 
and the materials on the surface of the structure.</p>

<p>There are several types of surface reaction in PMC depending on their products. 
The syntax of a surface reaction resembles the syntax of a real chemical reaction: 
reactants are on the left side and products are on the right side of the reaction. 
Only one-way reactions are supported and only two reactants can appear on the 
left-hand side of the reaction, with the species in the gas phase (tagged with 
<tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt>) always being one of the two.</p>

<p>Stoichiometric reactions and mass preservation are not supported for PMC surface 
reactions. The following list shows the basic set of surface reactions that are 
available in PMC and the corresponding syntax using the <tt>add_reaction</tt> command:</p>

<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=adsorption \
   expression=&quot;A&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1A&lt;s&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=reemission \
   expression=&quot;B&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;s&gt; + B&lt;g&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=reflection \
   expression=&quot;C&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;s&gt; + C&lt;r&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=simple_etch \
   expression=&quot;D&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;v&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=sputtering_tracked \
   expression=&quot;E&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;p&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=sputtering_untracked \
   expression=&quot;G&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;q&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=nucleation \
   expression=&quot;H&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat2&lt;s&gt; + Mat1&lt;b&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=growth \
   expression=&quot;H&lt;g&gt; + Mat2&lt;s&gt; = Mat2&lt;s&gt; + Mat2&lt;b&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>The arbitrary species <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, <tt>D</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, 
<tt>G</tt>, and <tt>H</tt> are assumed to have been previously defined with the 
<tt>add_source_species</tt> command.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<a name="surface_reaction_types"></a>
<h2>5.2.3 Types of Surface Reaction</h2>

<p>In this section, the surface reaction types presented in 
<a href="#surface_reactions">Section&nbsp;5.2.2 Defining the Surface Reactions</a> are 
explained in more detail.</p>

<hr />

<a name="adsorption"></a>
<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=adsorption \
   expression=&quot;A&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1A&lt;s&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>The first reaction named <tt>adsorption</tt> is used to model the adsorption 
of species <tt>A</tt> on the surface of material <tt>Mat1</tt>. The product is a 
particle of a new material called <tt>Mat1A</tt> on the surface (tagged <tt>&lt;s&gt;</tt>) 
that replaces one particle of <tt>Mat1</tt>. The product can have any name, but 
<tt>Mat1A</tt> has been chosen to remember more easily that <tt>A</tt> was adsorbed on 
<tt>Mat1</tt>. The particle <tt>A</tt> consumed during this reaction is removed from the 
simulation.</p>

<hr />

<a name="reemission"></a>
<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=reemission \
   expression=&quot;B&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;s&gt; + B&lt;g&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>The reaction named <tt>reemission</tt> is used to model the reemission of species 
<tt>B</tt> from the surface of material <tt>Mat1</tt>. The products are the same as the 
reactants because the surface is not modified and species <tt>B</tt> has been put 
back into the gas phase. Nevertheless, it is possible to write a reemission reaction 
with a modified material on the surface.</p>

<p class="note">Species <tt>B</tt> are reemitted strictly isotropically from
the surface, even if the initial angular distribution from its source was not 
isotropic.<br /><br />

This reaction (<tt>reemission</tt>) is the <em>default reaction</em> executed 
by the PMC engine when the reactants on the left-hand side are used in other 
reactions that finally do not happen (stochastic process) in a cell.</p>

<hr />

<a name="reflection"></a>
<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=reflection \
   expression=&quot;C&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;s&gt; + C&lt;r&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>The third reaction called <tt>reflection</tt> is distinguished from the 
<tt>reemission</tt> reaction by the product <tt>C</tt> tagged with <tt>&lt;r&gt;</tt> 
instead of <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>In this case, species <tt>C</tt> is reflected specularly (incidence angle 
equals reflection angle) on the surface of <tt>Mat1</tt>. It is possible to adjust 
the angular distribution of the reflected species in the properties of the specific 
reaction as shown later.</p>

<hr />

<a name="simple_etch"></a>
<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=simple_etch \
   expression=&quot;D&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;v&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>Regarding the reaction <tt>simple_etch</tt>, species <tt>D</tt> reacts with 
<tt>Mat1</tt> to produce the volatile species <tt>Mat1</tt> (tagged <tt>&lt;v&gt;</tt>). 
The volatile species can have a different name than the material on the surface. 
Particles <tt>D</tt> and <tt>Mat1</tt> consumed during this reaction are removed 
from the simulation. This means that, in this reaction, one incident particle 
<tt>D</tt> removes one particle <tt>Mat1</tt> from the surface.</p>

<hr />

<a name="sputtering"></a>
<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=sputtering_tracked \
   expression=&quot;E&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;p&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=sputtering_untracked \
   expression=&quot;G&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;q&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>In cases when an energetic particle (mainly ions) impacts the surface, its kinetic 
energy might be enough to remove more than one particle at the same time (high yield). 
Such a mechanism is <em>sputtering</em>. In order to model it, a separate type of 
reaction is introduced in PMC where you need to specify a yield function to let the 
simulator know how many particles can be removed by the incoming particle. The ejected 
particles from the surface go into the gas phase, and they can potentially react with 
the materials on the surface.</p>

<p>If you want the simulator to track those ejected particles, so as to use them 
in the left-hand side of other reactions, you must use a reaction like the 
one named <tt>sputtering_tracked</tt>, where the ejected species on the right-hand side 
(products) are tagged with <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>Tracking ejected particles requires a certain amount of additional memory and CPU 
resources. So, in cases where you do not need to use the sputtered species in the 
left-hand side of other reactions, you can save computational resources by using a 
reaction like <tt>sputtering_untracked</tt>, where the particles (tagged <tt>&lt;q&gt;</tt>) 
that are removed from the surface are not tracked.</p>

<p>In both cases of sputtering reactions, you must provide a yield function for the 
reaction using the <tt>define_yield</tt> command as shown in 
<a href="./stopo_4.html#neuionfluxsput">
Section&nbsp;4.2.3 Modeling a Neutral Flux and an Ion Flux With Sputtering</a>. 
The yield function can be angle dependent and energy dependent, and can be 
customized by using an analytic formula as you will see later in the sputtering 
example.</p>

<hr />

<a name="deposition"></a>
<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=nucleation \
   expression=&quot;H&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat2&lt;s&gt; + Mat1&lt;b&gt;&quot;

add_reaction model=demo  name=growth \
   expression=&quot;H&lt;g&gt; + Mat2&lt;s&gt; = Mat2&lt;s&gt; + Mat2&lt;b&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>So far, the reactions have as products either species that go to the gas phase or 
species that stay at the surface. The last reactions, <tt>nucleation</tt> 
and <tt>growth</tt>, introduce a new type of product tagged with <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>The particle of product species tagged with <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> is moved into the 
volume (bulk) of the structure and a particle of the product species tagged with 
<tt>&lt;s&gt;</tt> is added on top and becomes a new surface particle. In this way, 
material can be deposited on the surface.</p>

<p>The <tt>nucleation</tt> reaction is about adding, at the surface, a particle of a 
species that differs from the material that is already on the surface. The 
<tt>growth</tt> reaction is a deposition reaction that adds a particle of the same 
material as the existing material on the surface.</p>

<p>In general, for a deposition to proceed, both a nucleation reaction and a growth 
reaction are needed. If only a nucleation reaction is present, a monolayer of the 
material will be deposited, unless the deposited material is the same as the existing 
material on the surface. In both reactions, <tt>nucleation</tt> and <tt>growth</tt>, 
the reacting particle in the gas phase (precursor, <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tag) is removed 
from the simulation after the reaction happens.</p>

<a name="finalize_model"></a>
<h2>5.2.4 Finalizing the Model</h2>

<p>After you have introduced all the source species and the necessary surface
reactions, your model is ready to be finalized and used. As for RFM models,
the command <tt>finalize_model</tt> must be added at the end of all source species
and reaction additions to close the definition of a PMC model. The following 
example shows a complete model definition for etching:</p>

<pre>
define_model name=Si_F_Etch description=&quot;Etching Si with Fluorine&quot;
add_source_species name=F model=Si_F_Etch

add_reaction name=adsorb_F_Si model=Si_F_Etch \
  expression=&quot;F&lt;g&gt; + Silicon&lt;s&gt; = SiF&lt;s&gt;&quot;

add_reaction name=adsorb_F_SiF model=Si_F_Etch \
  expression=&quot;F&lt;g&gt; + SiF&lt;s&gt; = SiF2&lt;s&gt;&quot;

add_reaction name=adsorb_F_SiF2 model=Si_F_Etch \
  expression=&quot;F&lt;g&gt; + SiF2&lt;s&gt; = SiF3&lt;s&gt;&quot;

add_reaction name=etch_F_SiF3 model=Si_F_Etch \
  expression=&quot;F&lt;g&gt; + SiF3&lt;s&gt; = SiF4&lt;v&gt;&quot;

finalize_model name=Si_F_Etch
</pre>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<a name="3"></a>
<h1>5.3 Defining the Source Species Characteristics</h1>

<p>PMC model definitions contain all the source species used by the models, but their 
properties (such as fluxes, angular and energy distribution functions, and yields) 
are not yet defined.</p>

<!-- =============================== -->
<a name="distributions"></a>
<h2>5.3.1 Defining the Source Species Distribution</h2>

<p>To define the distribution function of a species and its flux, you use the command 
<tt>define_species_distribution</tt>. For example:</p>

<pre>
define_species_distribution name=distribution species=A exponent=1 flux=1.0e-3 
define_species_distribution name=distribution species=B exponent=10 flux=1.0e-4
define_species_distribution name=distribution species=C exponent=100 \
  flux=3.4e-5 energy_min=5 energy_max=100
</pre>

<p>The keyword <tt>exponent</tt> defines the angular distribution of the species 
based on the formula cos<sup><em>m</em></sup>(&theta;) (as discussed in 
<a href="./stopo_2.html#3.1">Section&nbsp;2.3.1 Defining the Deposition Model</a>). 
In contrast to level-set models, in PMC, the fluxes of source species are not normalized, 
but they are defined in absolute values with the keyword <tt>flux</tt> 
([mol s<sup>-1</sup>m<sup>-2</sup>]).</p>

<p>As you can observe, the distributions of species <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, and 
<tt>C</tt> share the same name. This means that they are grouped in the same 
collection of distribution functions (<tt>name=distribution</tt>) and, 
whenever this collection is called, all the source species distributions defined in it 
can be used. The distributions of all the source species used in a specific PMC model 
should be grouped together under the same name.</p>

<p>Note that, in the distribution collection defined before named <tt>distribution</tt>, 
there are species that are energy independent (<tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>) as well as 
species that are energy dependent (<tt>C</tt>). Although this is allowed, you cannot use 
<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, and <tt>C</tt> in the same PMC model. The species used in a PMC 
model can be either energy dependent or energy independent.</p>

<p>It is possible to visualize the defined distributions using the <tt>save</tt> command. 
Plots are saved in a TDR file and can be viewed with Sentaurus Visual. All the distributions 
in the collection will be saved in the TDR file. For example:</p>

<pre>
save species_distribution=distribution file=distr_functions.tdr
</pre>

<p><a href="images/tp_pmc_species_distr_ABC.png"><img src="images/tp_pmc_species_distr_ABC.png" 
width="570" alt="Species A and B distribution, and contour plot for species C" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 1. (Left) Plots of the distributions of species <tt>A</tt> and 
<tt>B</tt>, and (right) 2D contour plot of the energy-dependent distribution of 
species <tt>C</tt>. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<!-- =============================== -->
<a name="distr_energy_dep"></a>
<h2>5.3.2 Energy Dependency of the Species Distribution Function</h2>

<p>The distribution functions for species <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> do not contain 
any energy statement, which means the <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> particles emitted from 
the source do not carry any energy information &ndash; they are energy independent. On 
the other hand, the distribution for species <tt>C</tt> contains the keywords 
<tt>energy_min</tt> and <tt>energy_max</tt> (uniform distribution between the two values), 
which renders it energy dependent.</p>

<p class="note">The distribution definitions for all species used in a PMC model are 
allowed to be either energy dependent or energy independent. You cannot mix 
energy-dependent and energy-independent source species in the same PMC model. So, 
depending on the distributions of the source species used in a PMC model, the latter 
can be characterized as either an energy-dependent or an energy-independent PMC model.</p>

<!-- =============================== -->
<a name="yield_function"></a>
<h2>5.3.3 Defining the Source Species Material Yield Function</h2>

<p>Whenever a sputtering reaction is present in a PMC model, it is mandatory to 
provide a yield function for it. The yield function is defined in the same way as 
for an RFM model (see <a href="./stopo_4.html#neuionfluxsput">
Section&nbsp;4.2.3 Modeling a Neutral Flux and an Ion Flux With Sputtering</a>). 
The <a href="#sputtering">sputtering example</a> in 
<a href="#surface_reaction_types">Section&nbsp;5.2.3 Types of Surface Reaction</a> 
used species <tt>E</tt> and <tt>G</tt> in sputtering reactions. For those species, 
it is necessary to define yield functions. For example:</p>

<pre>
define_yield name=yield species=E material=Mat1 \
  energy=0 yield_max=1.5 theta_max=54 yield_at_zero=1.0

define_yield name=yield species=G material=Mat1 \
  expression=&quot;max(0,((3.0*(sqrt(E)-sqrt(50.0)))*(1.0 - pow(sin(theta),10))))&quot;
</pre>

<p>The defined yield for species <tt>G</tt> when it reacts with <tt>Mat1</tt> uses 
an expression that is energy dependent (square root of <tt>E</tt>). This means that 
species <tt>G</tt> is part of an energy-dependent PMC model. Nevertheless, it is 
possible to use an energy-independent yield function even if the associated species 
is part of an energy-dependent PMC model, but not the other way around (that is, 
you cannot use an energy-dependent yield function for a species that is part of an 
energy-independent PMC model).</p>

<p>As this is the case for the source species distributions, yield definitions can be 
grouped in one yield collection by attributing the same name to all the yield definitions 
that belong to the collection.</p>

<p>As for the species distributions, it is possible to visualize the defined yields by 
using the <tt>save</tt> command. Plots are saved in a TDR file and can be viewed with 
Sentaurus Visual. All the yields in the collection will be saved in the TDR file. 
For example:</p>

<pre>
save yield=yield file=yield_functions.tdr energy_min=0 energy_max=100
</pre>

<p>When a collection for yield functions contains elements that are energy dependent, 
you must use the keywords <tt>energy_min</tt> and <tt>energy_max</tt> to  produce 2D 
contour plots of the yield functions.</p>

<p><a href="images/tp_pmc_yield_EG.png"><img src="images/tp_pmc_yield_EG.png" 
width="570" alt="E and G species yield functions" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. Two-dimensional contour plots of the yield functions of 
(left) species <tt>E</tt> and (right) species <tt>G</tt>. The yield function of 
species <tt>G</tt> is energy dependent. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<!-- =============================== -->
<a name="default_event"></a>
<h2>5.3.4 Defining the Source Species Properties: Default Event</h2>

<p>As previously shown in the <a href="#reemission">reemission reaction</a>, 
this type of reaction (reemission) occurs by default (no need to explicitly add it 
in the model) if the main reaction between the specified reactants does not occur.</p>

<p>Each reaction of a PMC model has a probability to happen and you will see later
how to define this probability. If the defined probability for a reaction is &lt; 1, 
there is the likelihood that this reaction does not occur. In that case, the event, 
by default, is the reemission of the gas species from the surface at the point of 
incidence, which happens with an isotropic angular distribution.</p>

<p>You can change the behavior for the default event and discard the incoming gas 
particle instead of reemitting it with the following command:</p>

<pre>
define_species_properties default_event=discard name=properties species=C
</pre>

<p>Discarding the non-reacting gas particle means that it is removed from the simulation 
and it cannot react further with any surface material. Changing the default event 
is useful when you want to preserve the anisotropic characteristics of a species. 
If a gas species with a narrow angular distribution (high <tt>exponent</tt> value) 
does not react at a surface site and it is reemitted isotropically, then it starts to lose 
its anisotropic characteristics, and this behavior can lead to unexpected effects such as an 
increase in lateral etching. Figure&nbsp;3 shows an exaggerated example of this parasitic 
effect.</p>

<p><a href="images/tp_pmc_default_event_01.png"><img src="images/tp_pmc_default_event_01.png" 
width="570" alt="Structures showing default_event=discard and default_event=reemit" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Default event effect on etching: (left) default event has 
changed to <tt>discard</tt> and (right) default event has retained its default value, that is, 
<tt>reemit</tt>. The effect on the shape is dramatic because the anisotropic species used 
for etching lose their highly directional character when <tt>default_event=reemit</tt> as 
they are reemitted isotropically from the surface. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The properties of multiple species can also be part of a collection if they are 
defined with the same name, as is the case for the distributions and yield functions.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<a name="4"></a>
<h1>5.4 Defining the PMC Machine</h1>

<p>The third step in the PMC process setup is the definition of a <em>machine</em>, which 
assembles the defined PMC model with the source species characteristics. In the following 
example, the fluorine PMC etching model of silicon is used to show the assembly in the machine 
with the fluorine distribution:</p>

<pre>
define_model name=Si_F_Etch description=&quot;Etching Si with Fluorine&quot;
add_source_species name=F model=Si_F_Etch

add_reaction name=adsorb_F_Si model=Si_F_Etch \
   expression=&quot;F&lt;g&gt; + Silicon&lt;s&gt; = SiF&lt;s&gt;&quot;

add_reaction name=adsorb_F_SiF model=Si_F_Etch \
   expression=&quot;F&lt;g&gt; + SiF&lt;s&gt; = SiF2&lt;s&gt;&quot;

add_reaction name=adsorb_F_SiF2 model=Si_F_Etch \

<p>In PMC, only the <tt>define_etch_machine</tt> command is used to define a machine 
even if the PMC model contains deposition reactions; this is the convention.</p>

<h1>5.5 Defining the PMC Model Reaction Properties</h1>

<p>The last step in the configuration of a PMC process is the addition of the 
properties of the surface reactions of the PMC model used in the machine. The 
properties are basically the probabilities of the surface reactions that are 
defined in the PMC model, which is used in the machine.</p>

<p>In the example of surface reactions used in 
<a href="#4">Section&nbsp;5.4 Defining the PMC Machine</a>, you have four reactions 
that need to have their probabilities defined. For this purpose, you use the 
<tt>add_reaction_properties</tt> command for each reaction of the PMC model. 
For example:</p>

<pre>
add_reaction_properties machine=F_etch_machine reaction=adsorb_F_Si p=0.7
add_reaction_properties machine=F_etch_machine reaction=adsorb_F_SiF p=0.5
add_reaction_properties machine=F_etch_machine reaction=adsorb_F_SiF2 p=0.5
add_reaction_properties machine=F_etch_machine reaction=adsorb_F_SiF3 p=0.005
</pre>

<p>Notice that both the machine name and the reaction name must be defined. This 
means that the properties of the reactions might differ for different machines. 
The keyword <tt>p</tt> defines the probability as a number between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>It is possible to use an analytic expression for the probability of a reaction 
that can depend on the incidence angle or the energy of the incident particle. To 
do that, you need to predefine the analytic expression for the probability using 
the <tt>define_probability</tt> command before using it in the 
<tt>add_reaction_properties</tt> command. For example, you could write:</p>

<pre>
define_probability name=adsorb_F_Si_prob expression=&quot;0.7*cos(theta)&quot;

add_reaction_properties machine=F_etch_machine reaction=adsorb_F_Si \
  probability=adsorb_F_Si_prob
</pre>

<p class="note">Note the difference in usage between the keywords <tt>p</tt> and 
<tt>probability</tt> in the <tt>add_reaction_properties</tt> command. The keyword
<tt>p</tt> is used to assign a number between 0 and 1; whereas, the keyword
<tt>probability</tt> is used to call a probability expression that has been
predefined with the <tt>define_probability</tt> command.</p>

<p>The probabilities that are defined with a mathematical expression using the 
<tt>define_probability</tt> command can also be saved in a TDR file for visualization. 
For example:</p>

<pre>
save probability=adsorb_F_Si_prob file=n@node@_probability.tdr
</pre>

<p><a href="images/tp_pmc_probability.png"><img src="images/tp_pmc_probability.png" 
height="400" alt="Plot of defined probability" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. Plot of the defined probability <tt>adsorb_F_Si_prob</tt>. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p class="note">For PMC models that contain more than one reaction with the 
<strong>same pair of reactants</strong> on the left-hand side, the 
<strong>sum of the probabilities</strong> of all those reactions with a common pair 
of reactants <strong>must not exceed unity</strong>. This is also valid for probabilities 
defined by mathematical expressions, meaning that the condition for the sum of probabilities 
&le; 1 must hold for all possible values of those expressions. Otherwise, an error is 
issued during runtime and the simulation stops.</p>

<p>If you have a reflection reaction, you can adjust the angular 
distribution (like a <em>beam spreading</em>) around the reflection (specular) direction. 
For example, assume you have defined the 
<a href="#reflection">reflection reaction as before</a>:</p>

<pre>
add_reaction model=demo  name=reflection \
   expression=&quot;C&lt;g&gt; + Mat1&lt;s&gt; = Mat1&lt;s&gt; + C&lt;r&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>Then, the properties of this reaction can be set as follows:</p>

<pre>
add_reaction_properties machine=demo_machine reaction=reflection \
   reflection_exponent=10 p=0.1
</pre>

<p>If the <tt>reflection_exponent</tt> is omitted, then all the particles are reflected 
along the specular direction without any spreading. The smaller the 
<tt>reflection_exponent</tt>, the broader the spreading of the reflected particles 
around the specular direction.</p>

<h1>5.6 Running the PMC Simulation</h1>

<p>You have completed the four steps needed to define a PMC process simulation and now 
it is time to run it. By convention, as for the machine definition, to run the PMC 
simulation only, you use the <tt>etch</tt> command, even if the PMC model contains 
deposition reactions. To activate the PMC engine, set <tt>method=pmc</tt>.</p>

<p>Regarding the boundary conditions (BCs) in PMC, by default, reflective BCs are applied 
to the particles on all the sidewalls of the simulation domain. It is also possible to 
assign periodic BCs on sidewall pairs with the <tt>define_boundary_conditions</tt> 
command.</p>

<p>The following example sets periodic BCs on the two sidewalls perpendicular 
to the x-axis:</p>

<pre>
define_boundary_conditions x=periodic
</pre>

<p>The meshing used in PMC is isotropic, so you only need to specify one value for 
the <tt>spacing</tt> parameter or to use the same one for all three directions 
(x, y, and z). For example:</p>

<pre>
etch method=pmc spacing= {0.005 0.005 0.005} time=1.0 machine=demo_machine
</pre>

<p>The next section presents some simple examples for etching and deposition 
to help you start using PMC simulations.</p>
