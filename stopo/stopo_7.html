<h1>7.1 Overview</h1>

<p>This section presents the standard steps needed to import a layout file, in GDSII or 
OASIS format, and to use this file to create masks for patterning materials in Sentaurus 
Topography 3D.</p>

<p>The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench in the directory 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/layout</tt>. If you are not familiar 
with Sentaurus Workbench projects, the preprocessed script file <tt>layout_t3d.cmd</tt> 
can be found in this directory.</p>

<p>To download the preprocessed script file, right-click the following link and choose 
<strong>Save Target As</strong>: 
<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/layout/layout_t3d.cmd">
layout_t3d.cmd</a>.</p>

<p>To execute the file in Sentaurus Topography 3D on the command line, enter:</p>

<pre>
&gt; sptopo3d layout_t3d.cmd
</pre>

<p>After the command file is executed, the generated TDR file is <tt>layout_t3d.tdr</tt>.</p>

<h1>7.2 Importing a Layout File (GDSII or OASIS)</h1>

<p>This section shows how to import a specific cell from a layout file (GDSII or OASIS), 
how to define a domain (clip) of the layout to be used, and how to specify the layers of 
the layout that need to be available for the creation of masks in Sentaurus Topography 3D.</p> 

<p>The command <tt>define_layout</tt> is used to import a GDSII file (file name with suffix 
<tt>.gds</tt>) or an OASIS file (file name with suffix <tt>.oas</tt>). The file name is 
selected with the <tt>layout_file</tt> parameter:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/layout/sptopo3d_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - import the layout" endExpr="##end - import the layout" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
define_layout name= $layout_name layout_file= &quot;layout.oas&quot; \
  layer_numbers= {41:0 46:0 47:0 48:0 50:0 52:0 54:0}\
  layer_names= {layer1 layer2 layer3 layer4 layer5 layer6 layer7}\
  cell= $cell\
  domain= $domain domain_min= {-2.300 -1.500} domain_max= {2.200 2.000} \
  scale= 1.0 shift_to_origin= @shift_to_origin@ 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The following keywords are mandatory for the complete definition of the layout:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>name</tt> sets the name of the defined layout to be used within Sentaurus Topography 3D.</li>
  <li><tt>layout_file</tt> sets the name of a GDSII or an OASIS file from which the layout is read.</li>
  <li><tt>layer_numbers</tt> sets a list of layer numbers that are read from a GDSII or an OASIS layout file.</li> 
  <li><tt>layer_names</tt> sets a list of layer names to be used instead of the layer numbers specified in the
      <tt>layer_numbers</tt> parameter. The number of entries in both lists must be the same.</li>
  <li><tt>cell</tt> sets the name of the layout cell from which a domain is extracted.</li>
  <li><tt>domain</tt> sets the name to be given to the domain that is extracted from a GDSII or an OASIS layout file.</li>
  <li><tt>domain_max</tt> sets the coordinate of the maximum point of the layout domain in the layout coordinate system.</li>
  <li><tt>domain_min</tt> sets the coordinate of the minimum point of the layout domain in the layout coordinate system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The imported layout can also be scaled with the parameter <tt>scale</tt> (default: 1.0).</p>

<p>The parameter <tt>shift_to_origin</tt> helps to align the defined layout domain (see Clip1 in 
Figure&nbsp;1) to the actual simulation domain. By default, it is set to <tt>true</tt>, which means 
that the lower-left corner of the layout domain will coincide with the origin (0,0) of the xy plane 
of the simulation domain (see Figure&nbsp;2).</p>

<p>If <tt>shift_to_origin=false</tt>, then the origin (0,0) of the layout domain will coincide with 
the origin (0,0) of the xy plane of the simulation domain (see Figure&nbsp;3). In the latter case, 
if the layout domain (clip) is defined far from the origin of the layout, then the result of the 
patterning with the masks defined from the layout might contain only some features (see 
Figure&nbsp;4), or even none of them, if the clip lies completely outside of the simulation domain.</p>

defined layout domain, Clip1. If shift_to_origin=true, then all features in the defined layout domain 
are available for patterning in the simulation space. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<h1>7.3 Creating a Mask From a Layer</h1>

<p>This section presents how to define a mask from a layer that is imported from a layout in the 
previous step. The command <tt>define_mask</tt> is used for this purpose with parameters for the 
complete definition of the mask:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/layout/sptopo3d_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - define first mask" endExpr="##end - define first mask" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
define_mask name= mask_${layer1}_${domain} \
  layout= $layout_name domain= $domain layer= $layer1
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The name of the mask defined with the parameter <tt>name</tt> must be unique. The parameters 
<tt>layout</tt>, <tt>domain</tt>, and <tt>layer</tt> refer to the already defined layout, the 
layout domain, and the layer, respectively, with the <tt>define_layout</tt> command.</p>

<h2>7.3.1 About Masks, Reticles, and Photoresist Types</h2>

<p>The masks that are created in Sentaurus Topography 3D are sets of geometric shapes (polygons) 
that can be used to pattern materials in the structure,  and they do not have a polarity. The 
types of reticle (based on the defined mask) and types of photoresist assumed are defined 
at the patterning phase with the <tt>pattern</tt> or  <tt>etch</tt> command, and there are four 
combinations of reticle and photoresist types: <tt>light_positive</tt>, <tt>light_negative</tt>, 
<tt>dark_positive</tt>, and <tt>dark_negative</tt>.</p>

<p>A reticle has one of two types depending on whether the mask areas covered by polygons transmit 
or block light:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When exposing a reticle of type <tt>dark</tt> field, light is transmitted in areas that lie inside 
      of the layout polygons, and light is blocked in areas that lie outside of the layout polygons.</li>
  <li>When exposing a reticle of type <tt>light</tt> field, light is transmitted in areas that lie outside 
      of the layout polygons, and light is blocked in areas that lie inside of the layout polygons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar to reticles, there are different types of photoresist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When exposed and developed, a <tt>negative</tt> photoresist is removed from areas that were not 
      exposed to light, and it remains in areas that were exposed to light.</li>
  <li>When exposed and developed, a <tt>positive</tt> photoresist is removed from areas that were exposed 
      to light, and it remains in areas that were not exposed to light.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although there are four different combinations of reticle and photoresist types, there are only 
two possibilities for how material is deposited, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Material is deposited in areas where the polygons are located in the logical mask 
    (<tt>dark_negative</tt> and <tt>light_positive</tt>).</li>
<li>Material is deposited in areas that are not covered by polygons in the logical mask 
    (<tt>dark_positive</tt> and <tt>light_negative</tt>).</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering the resulting region from a patterning operation, it is redundant to provide 
all four combinations. Nevertheless, providing all combinations makes it possible to specify 
the intended process explicitly.</p>

<h2>7.3.2 Patterning Materials Using Masks</h2>

<p>The defined masks can be used to pattern materials by using either an additive approach with the 
<tt>pattern</tt> command or a subtractive approach with the <tt>etch</tt> command. For example, 
the mask in Figure&nbsp;2 could be used to pattern directly an aluminum layer (see Figure&nbsp;5) 
as follows:</p>

<pre>
pattern material=Aluminium thickness=0.5 mask= mask_layer1_Clip1 \
  type= light_positive 
</pre>

<p>The reticle type is defined in the <tt>pattern</tt> command and can be one of the types discussed 
in <a href="./stopo_7.html#3.1">Section&nbsp;7.3.1 About Masks, Reticles, and Photoresist Types</a>. 
The sidewall profile from this etch is vertical, corresponding to a perfectly anisotropic etching.</p>

<p>It would have been possible to use the <tt>etch</tt> command instead of the <tt>pattern</tt> 
command to produce the plot in Figure&nbsp;5. An additional step would also be needed to deposit 
the aluminum layer first by using the <tt>fill</tt> command as follows:</p>

<pre>
fill material=Aluminum thickness=0.5
etch thickness=0.5 mask= mask_layer1_Clip1 type= light_positive
</pre>

<h1>7.4 Mask Operations</h1>

<p>Previously defined masks can be combined in pairs with binary operations.</p>

<p>This section presents the different ways that two masks can be combined to generate 
new masks. Masks that are derived from binary operations can themselves be used in new 
operations with other masks.</p>

<p>The binary operations that are used to form a new mask can be interpreted as set operations 
(<tt>difference</tt>, <tt>intersection</tt>, <tt>symmetric_difference</tt>, or <tt>union</tt>) 
on the polygons in the masks. Except for <tt>difference</tt>, these operations can also be 
interpreted as simple Boolean operations (<tt>not</tt>, <tt>and</tt>, <tt>xor</tt>, or <tt>or</tt>) 
where areas covered by polygons have the value <tt>true</tt>, and areas that are not covered by polygons 
have the value <tt>false</tt>.</p>

<p>To combine two masks with an operation, the command <tt>define_mask</tt> is used as follows:</p>

<pre>
define_mask name= Mask_Operation operation= @operation@  \
  mask1= &quot;Mask_1&quot; mask2= &quot;Mask_2&quot;
</pre>

<p>The Sentaurus Workbench parameter <tt>@operation@</tt>, for the mask operation between 
<tt>Mask_1</tt> and <tt>Mask_2</tt>, can take one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>difference</tt></li>
  <li><tt>intersection</tt></li>
  <li><tt>symmetric_difference</tt></li>
  <li><tt>union</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that, for the <tt>difference</tt> and <tt>symmetric_difference</tt> operations, 
the order in which  masks are defined with the parameters <tt>mask1</tt> and <tt>mask2</tt> plays a role 
in the final result as the <tt>difference</tt> operation is <tt>mask1</tt> &ndash; <tt>mask2</tt>.</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;6 shows the result of the mask operations with the help of the top views of patterned 
materials. The result of patterning aluminum with <tt>Mask_1</tt> is the upper-left plot. Copper 
is patterned only with <tt>Mask_2</tt>. The other plots show the patterning of tungsten with the four 
different combinations of <tt>Mask_1</tt> with <tt>Mask_2</tt> by using the <tt>difference</tt>, 
<tt>intersection</tt>, <tt>symmetric_difference</tt>, and <tt>union</tt> mask operations.</p>

<p><a href="images/tp_mask_ops.png"><img src="images/tp_mask_ops.png" width="570" 
alt="Mask operations" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. Mask operations between two masks, Mask 1 and Mask 2. Plots 
are top views of patterned materials. Patterning an aluminum layer with Mask 1 produces 
the upper-left plot (gray-colored material). Copper is patterned with Mask 2. Tungsten 
(blue-colored material) is patterned with various combinations of Mask1 and Mask 2 using 
the difference, intersection, symmetric_difference, and union mask operations. 
(Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The operation <tt>complement</tt> is reserved for a single mask. As its name suggests, 
this operation generates a new mask where the polygon area coverage is inverted, that is, 
areas that were previously not covered by polygons are now covered, and vice versa. The syntax 
to create the complement of an existing mask is as follows:</p>

<pre>
define_mask name= CMask operation= complement mask1= Mask
</pre>

<h1>7.5 Sidewall Profiles</h1>

<p>Often when a layer needs to be patterned, it is critical to accurately reproduce 
the shape of the layer's sidewalls after this patterning step, as it could affect the 
geometry of the generated features in subsequent steps. In Sentaurus Topography 3D, you 
can create patterned layers as shapes that have a particular sidewall profile.</p>

<p>This functionality is demonstrated on the geometry of structure <tt>S4</tt> in the 
Sentaurus Workbench project mentioned in <a href="./stopo_7.html#1">Section&nbsp;7.1 Overview</a>. 
The <tt>define_shape</tt> command with the <tt>deposit</tt> command generate a 
patterned shape with a mask with a specific sidewall profile as follows:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sptopo3d/layout/sptopo3d_t3d.cmd" startExpr="##start - patterning with single mask with layer1 and sidewall profile in structure S4" endExpr="##end - patterning with single mask with layer1 and sidewall profile in structure S4" excludelines="##*" -->
<pre>
define_shape name=shape1 type=mask reticle_resist_type=@reticle_type@  \
  profile= {0.0 2.5 -0.02 2.25 +0.01 2.1 -0.01 2.0} \
  mask=mask_${layer1}_${domain} 

deposit material=Photoresist shape=shape1 structure= S4
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The parameter <tt>reticle_resist_type</tt> can take the following values defined by the 
Sentaurus Workbench parameter <tt>@reticle_type@</tt>: <tt>light_positive</tt>, 
<tt>light_negative</tt>, <tt>dark_positive</tt>, and <tt>dark_negative</tt>.</p>

<p>The sidewall profile is defined with the parameter <tt>profile</tt> and a list of values in pairs.
The first value in the pair is the offset length in micrometers of the sidewall at the specified 
z-coordinate, which is the second value in the pair. The offset length is the distance of the sidewall 
surface point at the specified z-coordinate from the plane formed by a virtual perfectly vertical 
sidewall at the mask edge.</p>

<p>If the offset length is negative, then the sidewall is retracted with respect to the vertical 
sidewall plane. The opposite occurs when the offset length is positive, creating an overhang of 
the sidewall at that point. A linear interpolation is used to define the sidewall profile between 
two z-coordinate points in the profile list.</p>

<p>At the top of the photoresist (z-coordinate is 2.5&nbsp;&mu;m), the offset length is 0.0. 
At Z=2.25&nbsp;&mu;m, the sidewalls are retracted by 20&nbsp;nm and, at Z=2.1&nbsp;&mu;m, 
the sidewalls have an overhang of 10&nbsp;nm. Finally, at the bottom of the photoresist, the 
sidewalls are again retracted by 10&nbsp;nm.</p>

<p>Figure 7 shows the cross section of the patterned photoresist profile with the corresponding 
profile pairs. Figure&nbsp;8 shows the resulting photoresist structure.</p>

alt="Sidewall profile" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. Patterning of a photoresist layer with a specific sidewall 
profile. The defined profile is applied to all sidewalls. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>The sidewall profile can also be defined by using the slope of the sidewalls between 
two specific z-coordinates using the <tt>taper_angles</tt> parameter. For example:</p>

<pre>
define_shape name=shape2 type=mask mask=mask2 \
  z_coordinates={3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0} taper_angles={ -10  15  0  -5 }
</pre>

<p>Here, the slope is &ndash;10&deg; (retracting sidewall) between Z=3.0&nbsp;&mu;m and Z=2.5&nbsp;&mu;m, 
then 15&deg; between Z=2.5&nbsp;&mu;m and Z=2.0&nbsp;&mu;m, and so on for the other values of 
<tt>z_coordinates</tt> and <tt>taper_angles</tt>. Note that the length of the <tt>taper_angles</tt> list 
is <em>N</em> &ndash; 1, where <em>N</em> is the length of the <tt>z_coordinates</tt> list.</p>
