<h1>1.1 Overview</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Topography 3D is a three-dimensional simulator for evaluating 
and optimizing critical topography-processing steps such as etching and deposition. 
Structures composed of an arbitrary number of different materials can be handled.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Topography 3D simulates process steps on 3D structures. Nevertheless, the 
two-dimensional (2D) mode (<strong>for the level-set engine only</strong>) of 
Sentaurus Topography 3D makes the physical models available also for 2D structures. 
Therefore, both 2D and 3D structures can be simulated with the same physical models, 
with consistent results. This feature allows you to calibrate models efficiently and 
to save considerable simulation time when a 3D structure is invariant along one direction 
and, therefore, it can be represented by a 2D cut of the 3D structure. Simulations 
with the <strong>particle Monte Carlo (PMC) engine</strong> are always run in three 
dimensions. For the same model and similar accuracy, the PMC engine is, in general, 
significantly faster than the level-set engine, up to factors of 100 and more.</p>

<p>The Sentaurus Process and Sentaurus Interconnect tools support a subset of 
Sentaurus Topography 3D functionality for advanced physical etching and deposition 
modeling (with both the level-set and PMC engines). This integration enables users of 
Sentaurus Process and Sentaurus Interconnect to easily incorporate one or more etching 
and deposition process steps into their simulation flow without having to create a 
separate command file and simulation node for Sentaurus Topography 3D.</p>

<p>Moreover, advanced lithography processes can be simulated with Sentaurus Topography 3D 
by invoking Sentaurus Lithography commands from within Sentaurus Topography 3D.</p>

<h1>1.2 Working With This Module</h1>

<p>This module presents the following examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up a basic simulation with built-in level-set etching and deposition models</li>
<li>Setting up simulations using the rate formula module (level-set engine)</li>
<li>Setting up simulations with the PMC engine for etching and deposition</li>
</ul>

<p>In the context of these examples, the most widely used Sentaurus Topography 3D commands 
are introduced for generating the initial structure, defining models, 
setting model parameters, performing the simulation, saving the final structure, 
and analyzing the simulation results.</p>

<p>This module discusses only the parameters and options used in the examples. 
For comprehensive model descriptions, refer to the <cite>Sentaurus&trade; Topography 3D User Guide</cite>.</p>

<p>A link to Sentaurus Topography 3D command files is given in each section. You are encouraged 
to create a local copy of the command file (choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>) 
and to run it. Some examples are given as packaged Sentaurus  Workbench projects. After 
creating a local copy, the files can be opened with Sentaurus Workbench.</p>

<!--================================================-->

<h1>1.3 File Types</h1>

<p>The main file types used in Sentaurus Topography 3D are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command file (<tt>*.cmd</tt>)<br />
This is the main input file for Sentaurus Topography 3D, containing all the simulation 
commands. It also can contain Tcl commands and is referred to as the <em>command file</em> or 
<em>input file</em>.<br /></li>
  
<li>Log file (<tt>*.log</tt>)<br />
Sentaurus Topography 3D generates this file during a run. It contains information about the 
initial structure definition, processing steps, computation mode, and the boundary conditions 
used in them, as well as information about the final structure saved. The amount of information 
written to the log file is controlled by the <tt>log_level</tt> parameter, which can be set 
globally with the <tt>let</tt> command. Possible values for <tt>log_level</tt> are <tt>info</tt> 
(default), <tt>all</tt> (more information is logged), and <tt>error</tt> (only error information 
is logged).<br /></li>

<li>TDR boundary file (<tt>*.tdr</tt>)<br />
This file stores the boundaries of the structure and surface plots, and can be loaded into 
Sentaurus Visual for visualization. The initial structure can be read from 
a TDR boundary file. Its name can be specified with the <tt>file</tt> parameter of the 
<tt>define_structure</tt> command of Sentaurus Topography 3D. The final structure is saved in 
the TDR boundary file format as well and can be used for further processing, for example, 
in Sentaurus Process or Sentaurus Structure Editor.</li> 
</ul>

<h1>1.4 Starting Sentaurus Topography 3D</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Topography 3D can be run either from within Sentaurus Workbench or on the 
command line. The command file, which contains the command sequence for the simulation, 
can be specified on the command line when starting Sentaurus Topography 3D, for example:</p>

<pre>
&gt; sptopo3d input.cmd
</pre>

<h1>1.5 Parallelization</h1>

<p>In Sentaurus Topography 3D, the source of reactants (in most cases, a plasma) consists 
of two kinds of particle: neutrals and ions. Neutral and ion fluxes can interact with the 
surface according to different physical effects. Neutrals can react with or can be reemitted 
from the surface. Ions can react with the surface, or can be reflected from the surface, 
or can sputter away the surface material itself.</p>

<p>Sentaurus Topography 3D offers different numeric methods to compute the distribution 
of neutral and ion particles over the surface, taking into account the modeled physical 
effects: the radiosity method (used by default) and the Monte Carlo method. For detailed 
information about physical and numeric modeling, refer to the 
<cite>Sentaurus&trade; Topography 3D User Guide</cite>.</p>

<p>The Monte Carlo method can use multiple CPU cores or CPUs to accelerate simulations 
on shared-memory computers. To activate multithreaded computation, use the command:</p>

<pre>
let parallel=true
</pre>

<p>You also need to specify explicitly the number of threads to be used with the command:</p>

<pre>
let num_threads=&lt;n&gt;
</pre>
