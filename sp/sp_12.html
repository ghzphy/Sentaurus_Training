<h1>12.1 General Considerations</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Process Kinetic Monte Carlo (Sentaurus Process KMC) models individual 
impurity atoms and individual point defects. Extended defects are modeled as aggregates 
of individual impurity defects and point defects in all combinations. This is in 
strong contrast to continuum modeling, which considers concentrations.</p>

<p>Since Sentaurus Process KMC deals with individual atoms and defects, it does not 
need a mesh, unlike continuum simulators. Nevertheless, it sets up a different kind 
of mesh, which is needed to define a list of particles that can interact with each other.</p>

<p>You can think of the KMC mesh as the simulation domain divided 
into a number of boxes. These boxes are created automatically. There is usually no 
need for users to influence the size or the number of these boxes. Another 
important difference to continuum simulations is that KMC simulations are always 
performed in three dimensions. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the 
simulation deals with individual particles. So, even if you want to simulate a 
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) structure (for comparison to SIMS measurements, for example), 
the simulation is performed internally in three dimensions.</p>

<p>Because of all these differences, switching between atomistic simulation and 
continuum simulation requires special attention.</p> 

<!--================================================-->
<a name="2"></a>
<h1>12.2 Simulation Example</h1>

<p>Here, a simple example demonstrates the most important issues that users must 
deal with when using Sentaurus Process KMC.</p>

<p>A commonly occurring situation is a quasi-1D simulation of an implantation followed 
by an annealing step to compare simulation results with measurements. Here, a simulation 
for an amorphizing implantation of germanium is performed, followed by a low-energy 
boron implantation and a long-time, low-temperature anneal. Experimental results have 
been published by Duffy <em>et al.</em> <a href="#duffy-2003">[Ref.&nbsp;1]</a>; a comparison 
of the KMC simulation results to these experiments was performed by Zographos 
<em>et al.</em> <a href="#zographos-2008">[Ref.&nbsp;2]</a>. In both papers, 
a certain range of implantation and annealing conditions was considered.</p>

<p>In this example, however, the use of Sentaurus Process KMC is illustrated only for 
one particular condition. This particular example was chosen for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The simulation time is sufficiently short.</li>
<li>The experimental conditions show a wide range of phenomena that are within the scope of a 
KMC simulation (amorphization, recrystallization, uphill diffusion, and extended defects).</li>
<li>Experimental results are available for comparison.</li>
</ul>

<p>The example is simple but demonstrates everything needed in more complex cases.</p>

<p>The complete project can be investigated from within Sentaurus Workbench in the directory 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC</tt>.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="3"></a>
<h1>12.3 KMC Settings for the Simulation</h1>

<p>The structure is set up as for a continuum simulation. Several switches control 
Sentaurus Process KMC and the output of the simulation. All of these switches have 
defaults, so it is unnecessary to set all of them explicitly. In this example, some 
of the most commonly switches are set and explained.</p>

<p>The parameters for the KMC simulation can be divided into three groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those for setting the size of the simulation domain.</li>
<li>Those for setting the simulation temperature.</li>
<li>Those for controlling the output.</li>
</ul>

<!--=========================-->
<a name="31"></a>
<h2>12.3.1 Parameters for Setting the Size of the Simulation Domain</h2>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="sp_12.html#1">Section&nbsp;12.1 General Considerations</a>, 
the simulation is always performed in three dimensions. Sentaurus Process expects users 
to specify the depth of the simulation domain (that is the thickness into the silicon 
that must be simulated). For the lateral directions, there are default settings that 
can be overwritten:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="pdbSet KMC MaxYum*" Lines=2 -->
<pre>
pdbSet KMC MaxYum 0.04
pdbSet KMC MaxZum 0.04
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p><tt>MaxYum</tt> is the size of the KMC simulation domain (in &mu;m) in the 
y-direction, and similarly <tt>MaxZum</tt> is the size of the domain in the 
z-direction. The size of the simulation domain must not be too small. The depth should 
be such that the simulation results are independent of it. For a typical application, 
this is the case for a depth of 0.75 &mu;m or more, which is deeper than the depths 
to which fast point-defects diffuse.</p>

<p>The depth of the simulation domain has a small impact on the simulation time because 
time is spent only to simulate particles. If there are only a few particles at the 
bottom of the structure, they have a negligibly small effect on the simulation time.</p>

<p>The lateral dimensions of the simulation cell must be wide enough so that both 
implantation cascades and extended defects can form freely. This condition is satisfied 
if the size of a cascade or an extended defect is smaller than half the size of the 
simulation domain. As you will see in <a href="#41">Section&nbsp;12.4.1 Ion Implantation</a>, 
the lateral size of the simulation domain strongly influences the simulation time. In 
<a href="#9">Section&nbsp;12.9 Improving Resolution of Concentrations</a>, you 
will see that the lateral size also influences the noise level of the simulation. Here, the 
lateral dimensions are chosen to be 40&nbsp;nm, which is sufficiently large for all defects 
and cascades to form, and small enough to allow a short simulation time.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<a name="32"></a>
<h2>12.3.2 Parameters for Setting the Simulation Temperature</h2>

<p>In a continuum simulation, effects at or around room temperature are usually not modeled. 
In a KMC simulation, phenomena at room temperature must be considered such as dynamic 
annealing during implantation. Therefore, the temperature at which the implantation is 
performed must be set, and the temperature ramp rate until the subsequent annealing 
temperature is reached can be set as follows:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="pdbSet KMC automaticRamp*" Lines=6 -->
<pre>
pdbSet KMC automaticRampUp   1
pdbSet KMC rampUpRate        100
pdbSet KMC automaticRampDown 1
pdbSet KMC rampDownRate      50

pdbSet MCImplant Temperature 300.0
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Here, the temperature at which the ion implantation is performed is specified to be 300&nbsp;K. 
Then, automatic ramp-up and ramp-down is switched on by Boolean arguments: the ramp-up with a rate 
of 100&nbsp;K/s, and the ramp-down with a rate of 50&nbsp;K/s. With these settings, the temperature 
can change continuously during the simulation, and you can specify annealing cycles in the same 
way as continuum simulations (and starting, for example, at 700&deg;C).</p>  

<!--=========================-->
<a name="33"></a>
<h2>12.3.3 Parameters for Controlling the Output</h2>

<p>You can collect information during KMC simulations and can save all the collected 
information when the simulation is finished. The most frequently changed parameters are:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="pdbSet KMC maxSnap*" Lines=3 -->
<pre>
pdbSet KMC maxSnapshots 3
pdbSet KMC Decade 3
pdbSet KMC Movie { kmc extract tdrAdd defects concentrations histogram}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>A <em>snapshot</em> is a set of particle positions at a given time. With the above 
settings, only one snapshot is kept in the computer memory. The next 
statement specifies that snapshots should be taken on a logarithmic time scale (<tt>Decade</tt>). 
In this example, three snapshots per time decade are kept in the memory (three 
from 1&nbsp;s to 10&nbsp;s, three from 10&nbsp;s to 100&nbsp;s, and so on, but only the 
last snapshot is kept).</p>

<p>The logarithmic time scale is usually taken because most changes occur in the first part 
of any annealing cycle. Alternatively, you can switch to a linear time scale (by replacing 
<tt>Decade</tt> with <tt>Every</tt>, and specifying the number of events after which a 
snapshot is written). These settings specify only at which times the snapshots of the 
simulation should be taken; the time step of the simulation is not influenced by these 
parameters.</p>

<p>The third statement specifies what should be saved in these snapshots. With 
<tt>defects</tt>, atomistic information will be saved (that is, particle positions). 
With <tt>concentrations</tt>, a conversion of atomistic data to continuum fields will be 
performed. With <tt>histogram</tt>, information about the distribution of certain cluster 
sizes will be saved. See <a href="#7">Section&nbsp;12.7 Visualizing Results</a> 
for examples.</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="4"></a>
<h1>12.4 Starting the Simulation</h1>

<p>To switch on the KMC model implemented in Sentaurus Process, use:</p>
 
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="SetAtomistic" Lines=1 -->
<pre>
SetAtomistic
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>With this command, any existing field will be atomized, and implantation and diffusion 
are performed by Sentaurus Process KMC. The next command loads a file with calibrated 
parameters:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="Advanced*" Lines=1 -->
<pre>
AdvancedCalibration 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>This file contains the recommended set of models and parameters calibrated 
to deep-submicron CMOS technology. The next lines (not shown here) define a mesh 
for a continuum simulation. This is needed for the structure representation and 
when the atomistic information is converted to field data. With the definition of 
the continuum mesh, you specify also whether the simulation will be performed 
internally in three dimensions (if the continuum mesh is specified only for one 
or two dimensions) or explicitly in three dimensions (if a 3D continuum mesh 
is specified). In this example, a 1D mesh is used because a simple comparison of 1D 
simulation results to 1D SIMS data is required. The process simulation steps are 
specified in the same way as for a continuum simulation.</p>
 
<!--=========================-->
<a name="41"></a>
<h2>12.4.1 Ion Implantation</h2>

<p>With the <tt>SetAtomistic</tt> command, the following simulation steps will be performed 
in atomistic mode. This means that the ion implantation is performed using the Monte 
Carlo method. There are, however, several differences to the use of the Monte Carlo 
implantation method in a continuum diffusion simulation.</p>

<p>First, every ion implanted in the KMC mode represents a <em>real</em> ion. This means 
that the number of ions to be implanted is calculated from the dose (specified in the 
<tt>implant</tt> command) and the surface area (specified explicitly by a 3D structure 
definition or implicitly if the structure is specified to be 1D). The number of ions is 
<tt>ions = dose x area</tt>. Therefore, in the present example, 19200 Ge ions 
(dose&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.2e15&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) and 16000 B ions 
(dose&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.0e15&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) are implanted onto a 
surface&nbsp;=&nbsp;40&nbsp;nm x 40&nbsp;nm.</p>

<p>This is in strong contrast to the use of the Monte Carlo implantation mode together 
with continuum diffusion. In that case, every implanted ion represents the full dose, 
and the accuracy of the simulation can be increased by increasing the number of implanted 
ions.</p>

<p>Second, in KMC mode, the implantation is performed with a realistic time dependency. 
During the time of implantation, all possible events can already occur. Most of these 
events have a relatively low probability (since ion implantation is usually performed 
at room temperature). The <em>annihilation event</em> of an interstitial recombining 
with a vacancy is likely, however, and occurs frequently during implantation. 
This process is the <em>dynamic annealing</em>.</p>

<p>Third, ion implantation in KMC mode must be performed in full cascade mode. 
This means that the full process of implanted ions kicking out silicon ions from the lattice, 
and then these ions kicking out the secondary ions from the lattice, and so on, is considered. 
The switch to full cascade mode is set automatically.</p>

<!--=========================-->
<a name="42"></a>
<h2>12.4.2 Diffusion</h2>

<p>Diffusion is performed in KMC mode because <tt>SetAtomistic</tt> is set. Annealing ramps 
are specified as in the continuum simulation mode. Model parameters are taken from the 
file <tt>AdvancedCalibration</tt> because this file is sourced after the <tt>SetAtomistic</tt> 
command.</p>

<p>Remember that automatic ramps from and to room temperature are switched on. The simulator 
input does not require any additional settings for this, similar to a continuum simulation.</p> 

<!--================================================-->
<a name="5"></a>
<h1>12.5 Comparing Simulation Results to Measurements</h1>

<p>One of the first things users usually want to do is to compare simulation results to 
experimental data. For this example, the simulation results are compared to the 
experimental results reported in <a href="#duffy-2003">[Ref.&nbsp;1]</a>. The experimental 
results were saved in ASCII files containing two columns: the depth (in &mu;m) and 
the concentration (in cm<sup>-3</sup>). The experimental files contain one header line.</p>

<p>The files that contain the corresponding simulated data are written during the 
simulation. One file contains the total (chemical) boron concentration after the 
implantation step, and a second file contains the total boron concentration at the end 
of the annealing step. These files are written in the same way as for a continuum simulation:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="SetPlx*" Lines=2 -->
<pre>
SetPlxList {BTotal BActive}
WritePlx n@node@_asimplanted_cont.plx
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The first command selects a list of fields, and the second command writes these 
fields into the specified file. When Sentaurus Process KMC is used, it is important 
to understand that this sequence maps the atomistic information onto the continuum mesh. 
This means that an averaging over the lateral dimensions is performed (because 3D positions 
must be mapped onto a 1D plot), and the assignment of particle positions onto mesh nodes 
in the third dimension (into the substrate) must be made.</p>

<p>The present example contains a Sentaurus Visual script that loads and displays the 
data from the simulation together with the experimental results, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1. 
To reproduce this figure, select the corresponding Sentaurus Visual nodes and click the 
<strong>Run Selected Visualizer Nodes Together</strong> toolbar button.</p>

<p><a href="images/sp_kmc_experiment.png"><img src="images/sp_kmc_experiment.png" width="570" 
alt="Comparing experimental and simulated boron profile after diffusion" /></a></p> 

<p class="caption">Figure 1. Experimental and simulated total boron profile 
after annealing. (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<p>It is important to understand what the simulator does at this stage. For Sentaurus Process 
KMC, a simple &quot;boron&quot; particle does not exist. Instead, there are mobile boron 
particles in different charge states, substitutional boron, boron particles as part of 
dopant&ndash;interstitial clusters, and more.</p>

<p>Upon execution of the <tt>WritePlx</tt> command, Sentaurus Process KMC maps all these 
different types of boron particle onto a quantity that Sentaurus Process knows exists 
in a continuum diffusion model. With the command as above, all boron particles in all 
configurations are counted and mapped onto the field <tt>BTotal</tt>, which is in fact the 
total (chemical) boron concentration. With such a procedure, you can easily extract 
concentrations (fields) in the same way as for continuum simulations, and it is very easy 
to compare continuum results with KMC results. Similarly, active concentrations such as 
<tt>BActive</tt>, interface concentrations such as <tt>BInterface</tt>, and net active 
concentrations can be extracted.</p>

<p>There is one more important point that you must remember when extracting data. For any 
atomistic simulation, the result is a set of defects having individual coordinates. This 
result does not depend on the continuum mesh. However, the result of mapping these coordinates 
onto the continuum mesh does depend on this mesh. Figure&nbsp;2 illustrates this effect. 
The KMC results are the same. They are mapped onto meshes with different spacing. The blue 
line uses a mesh with a spacing of 0.01&nbsp;&mu;m. This is too coarse and the peak 
of the concentration is not resolved at all. The red line uses a mesh spacing of 0.001&nbsp;&mu;m, 
and the green line uses a spacing of 0.0001&nbsp;&mu;m. The finer spacing does not bring any 
additional accuracy around the peak of the concentration. For lower concentrations, it only leads 
to more noise. This is because some of the small mesh elements might not contain any boron particles, 
which means that the concentration is zero. The next mesh element might contain only one boron 
particle but, since the mesh element is so small, the concentration is quite high.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. The effect of mapping atomistic data onto different meshes. 
Mesh spacings are 0.01&nbsp;&mu;m (blue), 0.001&nbsp;&mu;m (red), and 0.0001&nbsp;&mu;m 
(green). (Click image for full-size view.)</p>

<!--================================================-->
<a name="6"></a>
<h1>12.6 Extracting Further Information</h1>

<p>The KMC method has the advantage that it delivers more information than a conventional 
simulation.  All coordinates of all particles are known at any time step; therefore, you 
can extract profiles for any given defect at any time. In particular, you can extract 
profiles for all individual dopant&ndash;defect clusters, which are, in most continuum models, 
not taken into account individually. In the present example, you have:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="set BTotal*" startOccurence=2 endExpr="*KMC2Plx*" -->
<pre>
set BTotal   [kmc extract profile name= Boron ]
set BCluster [kmc extract profile name= Boron defectname= ImpurityCluster]
set ll [list $BTotal &quot;BTotal&quot; $BCluster &quot;BCluster&quot;]
KMC2Plx $ll n@node@_asimpl_kmc.plx
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The last command calls a Tcl procedure that is defined in the header of the command file; 
it writes data in the <tt>.plx</tt> format into a specified file. The second-last command 
is a Tcl command that puts certain data into a list. The first three lines use the Tcl command 
<tt>set</tt> to define variables (<tt>BTotal</tt>, <tt>BCluster</tt>, <tt>ThreeOneOne</tt>), 
and the value of these variables is defined to be the output of the command in brackets.</p>

<p>In the brackets, the <tt>kmc extract</tt> command extracts certain profiles. 
The first command extracts the profile <tt>Boron</tt>, which means all boron atoms in all 
possible configurations (charge state, whether it is part of a cluster, and so on) and, 
therefore, it extracts the total boron concentration.</p>

<p>The second command also extracts a boron profile, but it is restricted to boron atoms 
being part of an impurity cluster. The third command extracts all interstitials that are part 
of a {311} defect. The extraction of all these quantities is performed by mapping the atomistic 
information onto the KMC mesh in the vertical direction. In the lateral directions, the 
averaging is performed similarly to the method that uses <tt>WritePlx</tt> (as previously 
explained), but now the averaging is performed on the KMC mesh. Figure&nbsp;3 shows the 
result of such an extraction.</p>

<p><a href="images/sp_kmc_extract.png"><img src="images/sp_kmc_extract.png" width="570" 
alt="Extracted profiles" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Total boron concentration (blue), interstitials belonging to 
{311} defects (red), and boron belonging to clusters (green) after annealing. (Click image

<!--================================================-->
<a name="7"></a>
<h1>12.7 Visualizing Results</h1>

<p>During the simulation, information about all particles is collected (such as position, 
charge state, and being part of an extended defect). After an implantation step and 
a diffusion step, this information can be written to a TDR (<tt>.tdr</tt>) file 
using the <tt>kmc tdrWrite</tt> command.</p>

<p>This TDR file contains several snapshots of the simulation. The number of 
snapshots and the kind of information in the file is specified before the simulation step 
(see <a href="#33">Section&nbsp;12.3.3 Parameters for Controlling the Output</a>).</p>

<p class="note">The file size becomes very large when the KMC simulation contains many particles 
(especially I&ndash;V pairs during ion implantation) and when many snapshots are written.</p>

<p>In the present example, you specified <tt>defects concentrations histogram</tt> 
(see the <tt>pdbSet KMC Movie</tt> command in 
<a href="#33">Section&nbsp;12.3.3 Parameters for Controlling the Output</a>). 
With this choice, all available information is saved. When opening the <tt>.tdr</tt> 
file in Sentaurus Visual, several frames are displayed that will be discussed sequentially. 
The frames can contain several snapshots or only one snapshot, depending on the content of the frame.</p>

<p>Now, you will look at the output of this example, in particular, the output 
that is written after the annealing step (<tt>n1_anneal_fps.tdr</tt>). You 
specified that three snapshots per decade should be saved as well as a maximum 
of three snapshots. When loading the <tt>.tdr</tt> file, three frames are shown, 
containing several snapshots taken during the simulation. The last snapshot is 
written at the end of the simulation at 7206&nbsp;s (7200&nbsp;s for annealing 
and 6&nbsp;s for the automatic ramp-up from room temperature to 700&deg;C).</p>

<p>The first frame, labeled <tt>Plot_1</tt>, contains 1D snapshots for the 1D 
simulation domain. The simulation input specifies:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="pdbSet KMC Movie*" Lines=1 -->
<pre>
pdbSet KMC Movie { kmc extract tdrAdd defects concentrations histogram}
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Therefore, you see the following three datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>n1_anneal_fps_KMC_Simulation</tt> contains the atomistic defect 
concentrations (activated by the <tt>defects</tt> option).</li>
<li><tt>n1_anneal_fps_Cluster_histograms</tt> contains the cluster histograms 
(activated by the <tt>histogram</tt> option).</li>
<li><tt>n1_anneal_fps_Geometry_0</tt> contains atomistic data mapped onto 
the five-stream continuum diffusion model (activated by the <tt>concentrations</tt>
option).</li>
</ul> 

<p>Figure&nbsp;4 shows the total boron concentration versus depth as an example 
of the first dataset (<tt>n1_anneal_fps_KMC_Simulation</tt>). Information about 
all of the individual particles in all configurations is available. For mobile 
particles, the positions have been time averaged since the last snapshot. For 
immobile particles, the instant positions are mapped onto the KMC mesh. In 
addition, because the simulation domain is specified to be 1D only, the lateral 
information (in the y- and z-directions of the KMC simulation domain) is averaged.</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;4 also shows how to browse through the snapshots taken during 
the simulation (in the Selection panel, in the upper-left corner, click the 
<strong>Play</strong> <img class="imgline" src="images/sp_multistate_play.png" height="16" 
alt="Play button" /> button). The currently displayed snapshot is indicated as well as 
the total number of snapshots. You can play the sequence as a movie, or you can 
browse the snapshots forwards and backwards. This capability is available for 
all frames that have more than one snapshot.</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;5 shows the second dataset, a cluster histogram, where the 
number of interstitial clusters versus cluster size is plotted. You see 
that, at the given instance, there are four clusters consisting of eight 
interstitials.</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the <tt>n1_anneal_fps_Geometry_0</tt> dataset that contains 
the atomistic information mapped onto the five-stream continuum diffusion model 
and the continuum mesh (see Figure&nbsp;5). This dataset is written only at the 
end of the diffusion step.</p>

<p>The second frame, labeled <tt>n1_anneal_fps_Dopants</tt>, shows the 
dopant&ndash;defect clusters BxIy and BxVy (see Figure&nbsp;7). Such a plot is 
usually displayed best with the <strong>Convert to Nodal</strong> option switched off.</p>

<h1>12.8 Understanding Information in the Log File</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Process KMC prints a lot of information to the log file. Understanding this 
information is essential to understanding the results of an atomistic simulation.</p>

<p>First, the size of the KMC simulation domain and the continuum simulation domain 
are reported:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="KMC domain**" Lines=1 format="wrap"-->
<pre>
KMC domain (-0.1008, 0, 0) to (0.75, 0.04, 0.04) um Sentaurus domain (-0.1008, \
  0, 0) to (0.75, 0, 0) um. 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The KMC simulation domain is usually as big as the structure plus the gas. For the lateral 
dimensions, the values that are defined either implicitly or explicitly are used and printed 
here (0.04&nbsp;&mu;m in the present example). This simulation domain is divided automatically 
into several KMC boxes, and Sentaurus Process KMC reports the number in each direction and 
the minimum and maximum box sizes:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="KMC NonUni*" Lines=4 -->
<pre>
KMC NonUniformTensor. Boxes: 37440
	X=117 (0.8 - 35.8459)nm (-100.8 - 750)
	Y=16 (2.5 - 2.5)nm (0 - 40)
	Z=20 (2 - 2)nm (0 - 40)
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>Second, a table with a summary of the models used is given:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="| KMC models*" Lines=12 -->
<pre>
| KMC models     | Germanium                                       |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|Interstitial    |                                                 |
|   DiffModel    |Direct(I)                                        |
|   ChargeModel  |I( -2 -1 0 1 2 )                                 |
|   ClusterModel |I+I AmorphousPocket Void ThreeOneOne Loop        |
|Vacancy         |                                                 |
|   DiffModel    |Direct(V)                                        |
|   ChargeModel  |V( -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 )                            |
|   ClusterModel |V+V AmorphousPocket Void ThreeOneOne Loop        |
|Boron           |                                                 |
|   DiffModel    |                                                 |
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The table lists the diffusion model, possible charge states, the cluster model, 
and the model for solid phase epitaxial regrowth for all implemented impurities and 
for silicon and vacancies.</p>

<p>Third, the result of initializing the KMC simulation is printed:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="Particle*" Lines=2 -->
<pre>
Particle   Outside   Rejected    Created  (during atomizing Phosphorus)
P                 0          0          1 (Silicon)
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>A background concentration of 3.8e14&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup> phosphorus was specified. 
The size of the simulation domain allows then only one particle, which is created during 
the atomization process and is placed at a random position in silicon.</p>

<p>The next step in this example is the implantation of germanium. This process simulation 
step produces output such as:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="KMC: Time*" Lines=3 -->
<pre>
KMC: Time(s)   Temp(C)       Events Events/s Average step(s)   %Done
2.154435e-01     26.85         1512                            0.02%
4.641589e-01     26.85         4900             7.341069e-05   0.04%
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The table is self explanatory. The implantation occurred at room temperature, 
and the time was assumed to be 1000&nbsp;s. The next table is a summary of 
particles that have been created during the implantation step:</p>
 
<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="Particle*(during implant)" endExpr="KMC*" format="TrimStrmap({{     } {   }})" -->
<pre>
Particle   Outside   Rejected    Created  (during implant)
I           0      0    4912456 (AmorphousSilicon)    1008314 (Silicon)
V           4     3930    4927471 (AmorphousSilicon)   988090 (Silicon)
Sii        1994    15786
KMC: During 'implant' Alloys were incorporated as a field and not as a particle
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The last line is specific to the implantation of germanium. It states that 
Sentaurus Process KMC does not deal with individual Ge atoms after they are 
implanted, but germanium has been converted into a field (and, therefore, can 
be used for other purposes, such as stress calculation or in device simulations). 
In this table, <tt>Outside</tt> are particles that left the simulation domain 
by scattering processes. <tt>Rejected</tt> are particles that do not make sense 
in a certain material, such as anything in gas, or I and V in oxide.</p>

<p>In addition to this table, which is written after each implantation step, 
Sentaurus Process KMC produces several reports after each implantation step 
and each diffusion step:</p>

<ul>
<li>KMC particle distribution report</li>
<li>KMC cluster distribution report</li>
<li>KMC defect activity report</li>     
<li>KMC interactions report</li>
<li>KMC event report</li>  
</ul>

<p>In the following, these reports are listed and briefly explained. See the 
<cite>Sentaurus&trade; Process User Guide</cite> for details. After the 
annealing, these reports look like the following ones:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="*KMC Particle distri*" startOccurrence=2 Lines=5 -->
<pre>
--------------------- KMC Particle distribution report -----------------------
Material           Dopant   Total  State
AmorphousSilicon   B        13969    100.00% mobile
Oxide              B         1138    100.00% mobile
Silicon            B           11      0.00% active
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>This table lists the number of dopants in each material. In <em>full</em> materials 
(such as silicon), it states how many of the dopants are active (in substitutional places). 
In other materials (such as oxide), dopants are only mobile, that is, they are inactive and 
do not form clusters.</p> 

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="*KMC impurity cluster distri*" Lines=4 -->
<pre>
------------------  KMC impurity cluster distribution report -----------------
Name     #number
--- Silicon ---
BI2          4 
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>This table lists all of the present impurity clusters. The next table &ndash; the activity 
report &ndash; lists all particles that were present in this part of the simulation. The list 
contains particles that still exist at the end of the simulation step, but it also lists particles 
that disappeared (for example, extended defects that dissolved during annealing). The report 
contains two columns with three subcolumns each. The first report shows when the model was first 
used; the last report shows when the model was last used. If the model is still being used, 
the number of particles or defects using it is displayed followed by <tt>here</tt>. The three 
subcolumns report the time, the number of simulated events, and the temperature.</p>

<p>In this particular example, the first positively charged interstitial was created after a 
time of 0.19&nbsp;s at 27&deg;C, and the last one was observed after 7206&nbsp;s at 700&deg;C.</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="*KMC defect activity report*" Lines=7 -->
<pre>
------------------------- KMC defect activity report -------------------------

</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The next table is the interactions report. It lists all interactions in all materials 
that occurred during this part of the simulation. This table helps to understand which 
interactions are important. In this example, the interactions between neutral 
interstitials and between neutral interstitials and neutral vacancies dominate.</p> 

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="*KMC interactions report*" Lines=5 -->
<pre>
-------------------------- KMC interactions report ---------------------------

</pre>
<!-- grep end -->

<p>The last report is the event report. The information in this report depends 
on the specified hopping mode. Here, the <tt>double</tt> mode was used. The 
report lists, for each mobile particle, the number of jumps in opposite directions, 
in the same direction, and in the orthogonal direction. For particles that can 
break up, the number of breakup events during the simulation is listed in the 
last column:</p> 

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/n1_fps.out" startExpr="*KMC event report*" Lines=6 format="trim" -->
<pre>
---------------------------  KMC event report   ------------------------------
--- Silicon ---

PointDefect     V          170463       169371       675438
</pre>
<!-- grep end -->
              
<p>All these reports are written to the log file automatically. Of course, 
you can write more information to this file. For example, the following command 
counts the number of boron particles and prints this number to the log file:</p>

<!-- grep file="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/KMC/sprocess_fps.cmd" startExpr="*extract defects*" Lines=1 -->
<pre>

<h1>12.9 Improving Resolution of Concentrations</h1>

<p>From <a href="#5">Section&nbsp;12.5 Comparing Simulation Results to Measurements</a>, 
it is clear that the resolution of the concentrations cannot be improved by making 
the mesh onto which the results are extracted finer and finer. The only way to improve 
the resolution is to increase the surface area.</p>

<p>You can estimate the minimum concentration that can be resolved with a certain 
surface area. Assuming a surface area of 32&nbsp;nm x 32&nbsp;nm and a continuum mesh 
spacing of 1&nbsp;nm perpendicular to the surface, you see that one particle in such a 
thin slice represents a concentration of 1/1024&nbsp;nm<sup>-3</sup> = 1.0e18&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup>. 
This means that concentrations below that cannot be resolved, because having or not having 
that particle in this slice means having concentrations of 1e18 or 0, respectively.</p>

<p>To illustrate this effect, the same example with surface areas of 0.01&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, 
0.04&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, 0.1&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, and 0.15&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, 
corresponding to noise levels of 1e19&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup>, 6.25e17&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup>, 
1.0e17&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup>, and 4.4e16&nbsp;cm<sup>-3</sup>, was simulated.</p>

<p>The peak of the boron concentration is represented well in all simulations (see Figure&nbsp;9). 
Beyond the peak, however, it can be seen how each simulation reaches its noise level. The isolated 
lines at the right-hand side of the plot represent the effect of having only one particle in a 
slice or having none. Similarly, the limits of the resolution can be seen if you want to study 
the dynamics of extended defects. In Figure&nbsp;10, the concentration of interstitials belonging 
to {311} defects is plotted. With the smallest surface area, this concentration cannot be 
resolved at all. With bigger surface areas, the resolution improves.</p>

domains (green and red lines). (Click image for full-size view.)</p>
