<h1>11.1 Overview</h1>

<p>Sentaurus Process can perform all process steps, except for oxidation, 
in three dimensions as well. Implantation and diffusion steps do not 
require any special considerations in three dimensions, except for the 
fact that each of these steps takes significantly longer to complete when 
performed in three dimensions compared to two dimensions. As such, using 
a coarser mesh in three dimensions is recommended.</p>

<p>For process steps that change the structure, however, special care must 
be taken. These steps include etching, deposition, photo, strip, reflection, 
and cut. While the syntax in three dimensions is equivalent to two dimensions, 
the operations are more complicated and can require simplifications.</p>

<p class="note">Before starting any 3D project, it is a good idea to build the project 
in two dimensions and ensure it runs. Since simulations take longer in three 
dimensions, this can save a lot of time if the input is incorrect or does 
not produce the required results.</p>

<p>After the project runs in two dimensions, 3D input can be created by 
adding <tt>line z</tt> commands, which will make the initial structure 3D. 
It is recommended that you initially switch off the implantation and diffusion 
steps, so that only structure-modifying steps remain. These run relatively fast 
and, therefore, can be used to check whether the final structure is correct.</p>

<h1>11.2 Three-Dimensional Setup Without Implantation and Diffusion</h1>

<p>A few points are worth noting when setting up the initial flow without 
implantation and diffusion steps. The structure-modifying steps (etching, 
deposition, photo, and transform) take very little time, but mesh 
generation in three dimensions can be slow. The following suggestions will 
minimize the number of times Sentaurus Process needs to generate the 3D mesh 
and, therefore, will make the simulations run faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <tt>pdbSet Mechanics EtchDepoRelax 0</tt>. This switches off stress relaxation 
after etching and deposition steps and, therefore, switches off mesh generation after 
every step.</li>

<li>Use <tt>struct tdr.bnd=&lt;c&gt;</tt> to save the structure at intermediate steps 
rather than <tt>struct tdr=&lt;c&gt;</tt>. This avoids mesh generation when saving the 
structure and, therefore, speeds up the simulation. It is recommended that the 
structure is saved after each etching, deposition, and photo step to observe its evolution.</li>

<li>When inserting <tt>#split</tt> commands to split the process flow in
Sentaurus Workbench, try to put them either immediately before or immediately after
an implantation or a diffusion step. If <tt>#split</tt> is inserted between two
structure-modifying steps such as etching or deposition, it will force an unnecessary 
mesh generation.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a 3D setup without implantation and diffusion steps can be found 
in the project <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/SmallMOS_NoDiff</tt>.</p>

<p>The simulation generates a TDR boundary file at every structure-modifying step. 
Figure&nbsp;1 shows an animation of the evolution of the structure.</p>

<h1>11.3 Three-Dimensional Setup With Implantation and Diffusion</h1>

<p>After satisfactory results are obtained for the structure-modifying steps, 
implantation and diffusion steps can be switched on again. At this point, saving 
the structure with <tt>struct tdr.bnd=&lt;c&gt;</tt> is no longer necessary, but the 
other recommendations should be followed.</p> 

<p>The example 3D project with the implantation and diffusion steps can be found 
in the directory <tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/SmallMOS_Full</tt>.</p>

<p>Click to view the command file 
<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/SmallMOS_Full/sprocess_fps.cmd">
sprocess_fps.cmd</a>.</p>

<p>The project also includes remeshing for device simulation with Sentaurus Process, 
as well as device simulation with Sentaurus Device. The results of the 3D 
Sentaurus Process simulation are shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>

<h1>11.4 Switching From Two Dimensions to Three Dimensions</h1>

<p>As in 2D simulations, Sentaurus Process keeps the initial structure 
in 1D mode before an etch with a mask is encountered. As soon as the 
first 3D mask is encountered, the structure is extended to three 
dimensions according to the size specified by the <tt>line y</tt> and 
<tt>line z</tt> commands. Even in cases where the first mask is only 
one-directional (for example, a strip that extends beyond the simulation 
domain), the structure does not become 2D. Sentaurus Process does not 
differentiate between masks that would keep the structure 2D or masks 
that would make the structure 3D.</p>

<p>However, it can sometimes be useful to keep the structure in two 
dimensions as long as possible, so that oxidation can be performed. In 
such cases, you must explicitly state when to switch to 3D simulation.</p>

<p>This is achieved by initializing the simulation in two dimensions, 
that is, by specifying only <tt>line x</tt> and <tt>line y</tt> commands. 
After the 2D simulations are performed as usual, <tt>line z</tt> commands 
are used to extend the structure to three dimensions. After that point, 
the simulation becomes 3D.</p>

<p>The example 3D project where the switch from two dimensions to three 
dimensions is performed manually can be found in the directory 
<tt>Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/SmallMOS_2D3D</tt>.</p>

<p>Click to view the command file 
<a href="../../Applications_Library/GettingStarted/sprocess/SmallMOS_2D3D/sprocess_fps.cmd">
sprocess_fps.cmd</a>.</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows the results of Sentaurus Process. In contrast to 
Figure&nbsp;2, the initial plot is 2D since it is before the switch to 
three dimensions occurred.</p>

<h1>11.5 Linear Solvers</h1>

<p>The default linear solver for 1D and 2D simulations in Sentaurus Process is 
the direct solver PARDISO. For 2D diffusion and all types of 3D simulation, the 
iterative solver ILS is used by default.</p>

<p>To activate PARDISO for diffusion (<tt>diffuse</tt>) and mechanics (<tt>Flow</tt>) 
simulations, use:</p>

<pre>
math diffuse dim=2 pardiso
math diffuse dim=3 pardiso
math Flow    dim=3 pardiso
</pre>

<p>Similar syntax is used to activate ILS for 2D simulations:</p>

<pre>
math diffuse dim=2 ils
math Flow    dim=2 ils
</pre>

<p>In the case of poor convergence, you can improve the quality of the ILS preconditioning 
of the matrices by reducing the <tt>ILS.ilut.tau</tt> parameter, for example, from 
2x10<sup>-3</sup> (the default value for 3D diffusion) to 1x10<sup>-5</sup>, or even a 
smaller value.</p>

<p>The iterative solver GMRES stores a given number <em>m</em> of backvectors. If the solution 
does not converge within <em>m</em> iterations, GMRES restarts. Higher values of <em>m</em> 
improve convergence but increase memory use. You can set <em>m</em> in Sentaurus Process by 
changing the parameter <tt>ILS.gmres.restart</tt>.</p>

<p>Recommended values are between the default value of 60 to 100 for 3D diffusion:</p>

<pre>
pdbSet Math diffuse 3D ILS.ilut.tau 5e-5
pdbSet Math diffuse 3D ILS.gmres.restart 80
pdbSet Math diffuse 3D ILS.maxit 200
pdbSet Math diffuse 3D ILS.tolrel 1e-6
pdbSet Math diffuse 3D ILS.refine.residual 5
</pre>

<p>To activate parallel computation for each solver on four threads, for example, use:</p>

<pre>
math numThreadsILS=4
math numThreadsPardiso=4
</pre>
